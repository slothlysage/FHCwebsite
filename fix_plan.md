# fix_plan.md — FHCwebsite backlog

The agent works top-down. Pick the highest `[ ]` item whose deps are all `[x]`.
Each item has an **AC** (acceptance criteria) — the task is not done until the AC
is demonstrably true and `npm run verify` is green.

`🚦 HUMAN GATE` = stop, commit, and ask. Do not proceed.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

- [x] **0.1 Scaffold Next.js app**
      Deps: none.
      Next.js App Router + TypeScript `strict`, Tailwind, path alias `@/*`.
      AC: `npm run dev` serves a page; `npm run build` succeeds; `tsconfig.json` has
      `strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`.

- [x] **0.2 Test harness + coverage gate**
      Deps: 0.1.
      Vitest + RTL + jsdom, `@vitest/coverage-v8`. Thresholds per `AGENT.md`
      (80% global; 90% for `src/lib/services/**` and `src/lib/stripe/**`).
      Added `src/app/page.test.tsx` (RTL, asserts the heading renders) to prove
      the harness runs — 100% coverage on the only real source file so far.
      AC met: `npm run test:coverage` was verified to fail the global 80%
      threshold with a deliberately uncovered scratch file, then pass again once
      it was removed.
      `tsconfig.json`'s `exclude` no longer drops `vitest.config.ts`/`tests/`.
      NOTE for future iterations — install/config gotchas hit on this sandbox
      (Node 20.15, npm 10.7):
  - `npm install` did not fetch the platform-specific
    `@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu` optional dep that `vite@8`'s hard
    `rolldown` dependency needs (npm optional-deps bug). Fixed by
    `npm install --no-save @rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu@1.1.5`. If a fresh
    clone fails at `vitest run` with "Cannot find native binding", that's the
    cause.
  - Vite/Vitest config loading via CJS `require()` broke on an ESM-only
    transitive dep (`std-env`) because the package has no `"type": "module"`.
    Fixed by naming the config `vitest.config.mts` (forces ESM regardless of
    package `type`) rather than adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json`
    (which would be a bigger, riskier change for Next's own build).
  - `jsdom@29.x` pulls `html-encoding-sniffer@6`, which is ESM-only
    (`@exodus/bytes`) and breaks under vitest's CJS worker `require()`.
    Pinned `jsdom` to `26.1.0`, the last line whose `html-encoding-sniffer`
    dependency (`^4.0.0`) is CJS. Revisit the pin when vitest's default test
    environment loader handles ESM deps, or when jsdom's own require path
    is fixed upstream.

- [x] **0.3 Lint, format, and the `verify` script**
      Deps: 0.2.
      ESLint (next/core-web-vitals + @typescript-eslint, already scaffolded in
      0.1/0.2) now also runs `eslint-config-prettier` last in the flat config
      to disable stylistic rules that would fight Prettier. Added Prettier
      (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`), `format`/`format:check`
      scripts, a `typecheck` script (`tsc --noEmit`), and
      `"verify": "npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test:coverage && npm run build"`.
      Ran `prettier --write .` once to normalize all pre-existing files
      (formatting-only diff, verified via `git diff` — no logic changes).
      AC met: deliberately introduced a type error, confirmed `npm run verify`
      exits 1 and fails at the `typecheck` step; removed the scratch file and
      confirmed `npm run verify` exits 0 through lint, typecheck,
      test:coverage (100% on the one source file), and build.
      NOTE: `verify` does not run `format:check` — the AC's script string is
      exact from the plan. `format:check` exists as a standalone script if a
      future CI step wants a formatting gate; it isn't wired in by this task.

- [x] **0.4 Typed environment config**
      Deps: 0.1.
      `src/lib/env.ts` — two zod schemas: `serverSchema` (DB, Stripe secret,
      ALLOW_LIVE, admin bootstrap, R2, Resend, Sentry — only DATABASE_URL,
      STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET required, rest `.optional()`
      since nothing consumes them yet) and `clientSchema` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`,
      both required). Parsed once at module load via a `parseOrThrow` helper
      that throws one `Error` listing every invalid/missing field path — e.g.
      `- DATABASE_URL: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined`.
      Exports `env` (server-only, full set) and `clientEnv` (public subset).
      `clientEnv` reads each var through a literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_X`
      expression, not a `process.env` spread — Next's compiler only inlines
      literal member-expression reads into the client bundle, so a dynamic
      lookup would silently be `undefined` in the browser.
      Root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) imports `env` and uses
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` for `metadata.metadataBase`, which forces the
      parse to run during `next build`'s page-data collection — this is what
      makes the AC's build failure happen, not an explicit boot script.
      `.env.example` already had the right names/comments from 0.1; unchanged.
      Added `.env.local` (gitignored, dummy `sk_test_`/`whsec_` style values
      matching `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s dummy env block) so local
      `npm run dev`/`build` work without real credentials.
      AC met: emptied `.env.local` of `DATABASE_URL`/`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/
      `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, ran `npm run build`, confirmed it fails with
      `Invalid environment variables:` naming all three; restored the file,
      confirmed build passes again. `src/lib/env.test.ts` (5 cases: full
      success, missing required server var throws naming it, missing required
      public var throws naming it, `ALLOW_LIVE` string→boolean coercion,
      `clientEnv` excludes server secrets) — 100% coverage on `env.ts`.
      NOTE for later phases: when Stripe/R2/Resend/Sentry modules are actually
      built (3.1, 4.5, 3.7, 5.3), promote their now-`.optional()` vars to
      required in `serverSchema` at that point, not before — an unused
      required var would fail `npm run build` for no functional reason.

- [x] **0.5 CI pipeline**
      Deps: 0.3.
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml` already existed (from an earlier iteration,
      commit 801d4e6) but was broken: it ran `npm run db:migrate` (no such
      script — Postgres/Drizzle isn't wired up until 1.1) and had a second
      `e2e` job running `npm run test:e2e` (no such script — Playwright isn't
      installed until 5.5). Either would fail on a fresh clone of `main` right
      now, so the AC ("green on main") wasn't actually met despite the file
      existing and the checklist being unticked.
      Fix: removed the `postgres` service, the `Migrate test database` step,
      and the whole `e2e` job, leaving `verify` (checkout, setup-node@20,
      `npm ci`, lint, typecheck, test:coverage, coverage-summary → step
      summary, upload coverage artifact, build) — i.e. exactly `npm run
verify` plus the artifact/summary steps, matching what the repo can
      actually run today.
      Added `tests/unit/ci-config.test.ts`: a regression test that parses
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for every `npm run <script>` reference and
      asserts each exists in `package.json`'s `scripts`. This is what caught
      the bug (failed listing `db:migrate`/`test:e2e` as missing before the
      fix) and will catch it again if a future phase's CI step is added
      before its npm script lands.
      AC met: confirmed red by renaming the lint step's script to `lintxyz`
      (test failed, listing exactly that name as missing) and green again
      after reverting. `npm run verify` passes locally (lint, typecheck,
      test:coverage — 3 files/7 tests, 100%, build).
      NOTE for 1.1 and 5.5: when the DB schema and Playwright suite land,
      re-add the `postgres` service + `db:migrate` step to the `verify` job
      (or a new job) and a `test:e2e` job respectively — the guard test above
      will pass automatically once the corresponding npm script exists.

- [x] **0.6 Pre-commit hook**
      Deps: 0.3. Husky (`9.1.7`) + lint-staged (`16.4.0` — v17 requires Node
      `>=22.22.1`, incompatible with this sandbox's Node 20.15; v16 needs
      `>=20.17`, close enough that it only warns, doesn't fail). `npx husky
init` created `.husky/pre-commit` and added `"prepare": "husky"` to
      `package.json` (runs on `npm install`, wires the git hooks path).
      Replaced the scaffolded default (`npm test`, which the task explicitly
      says NOT to run — full suite is too slow for a hook) with `npx
lint-staged`. Added a `"lint-staged"` block to `package.json`: `*.{js,
jsx,ts,tsx,mjs,cjs}` gets `eslint --fix` then `prettier --write`;
      `*.{json,md,css}` gets `prettier --write` only (ESLint's flat config
      doesn't lint those).
      `tests/unit/pre-commit-hook.test.ts` (4 cases, following the
      `ci-config.test.ts` pattern of asserting against real repo files
      rather than mocking): hook file contains `lint-staged` not the full
      test command, hook file is executable (checks the POSIX exec bits via
      `statSync(...).mode & 0o111`), `package.json` has a `lint-staged`
      config whose commands include both `eslint` and `prettier`, and
      `prepare` script is exactly `"husky"`.
      AC met — verified live, not just via the unit test: staged a scratch
      file with `const bad = (x:any) => {...}` and ran `git commit`; husky's
      pre-commit hook ran `lint-staged`, `eslint --fix` failed on
      `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`, lint-staged reverted the stash
      and aborted, and `git commit` exited 1 — nothing was committed. Removed
      the scratch file afterward.
      NOTE: lint-staged's revert-on-failure flow uses `git stash` internally
      as a backup — if a hook run is killed mid-flight (e.g. `kill -9`) a
      stray stash entry can be left behind. Not hit in this iteration, just
      worth knowing if `git stash list` ever shows an unexpected entry after
      a bad commit attempt.

## Phase 1 — Data layer

- [x] **1.1 Database schema**
      Deps: 0.4. See `specs/02-data-model.md` — implement it exactly.
      `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — all 15 tables from the spec (no separate
      `customers` table; `orders.email` plus `addresses` covers it, matching
      the spec body which never actually defines a `customers` table despite
      the fix_plan bullet naming one — flagged, not guessed around, see the
      NOTE below) plus the `variant_stock` view (`SELECT variant_id,
coalesce(sum(delta),0)::int AS stock FROM inventory_movements GROUP BY
variant_id` — a plain, not materialized, view so it's always fresh with
      no trigger to keep in sync). `src/lib/db/client.ts` — drizzle
      singleton over `pg.Pool`, using `env.DATABASE_URL`.
      Installed `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `pg`, `@types/pg`. `tsx` was
      briefly added for a TS migration runner, then removed — see below.
      AC met: spun up a throwaway `postgres:16-alpine` docker container,
      confirmed `npm run db:migrate` applies cleanly to a fresh database (all
      15 tables + the view), re-running it on an already-migrated database is
      a no-op (drizzle's own `__drizzle_migrations` tracking table), and a
      full drop + recreate + re-apply cycle (the closest meaningful thing to
      "rollback" for a forward-only migration tool — drizzle-kit does not
      generate down migrations) also applies cleanly from empty.
      `src/lib/db/schema.test.ts` (4 integration tests against the real,
      migrated database): unique slug constraint, FK rejects an orphaned
      variant, `variant_stock` sums movements correctly, and a variant with
      zero movements has no row in the view (confirmed each test fails with
      `relation "products" does not exist` against an unmigrated DB, then
      passes after `db:migrate` — the red/green cycle AGENT.md requires).
      `src/lib/db/schema-indexes.test.ts` (14 more tests, via drizzle-orm's
      `getTableConfig`): asserts every explicit index from the spec's
      "Indexes to create explicitly" list exists by name, the
      `product_categories` composite PK, the case-insensitive unique index on
      `discount_codes.code`, and every `.references(() => otherTable.col)`
      FK actually points at the right table. This wasn't optional padding —
      drizzle's `extraConfig` callbacks (indexes/PKs/unique constraints) and
      FK target thunks are stored but never invoked by ordinary query
      building, only by `drizzle-kit`/`getTableConfig` — so without this file
      those lines were genuinely dead code from vitest's perspective and
      coverage sat at ~65-75%, not because anything was untested but because
      nothing ever called the lazy builders. Calling `getTableConfig` in a
      test is a legitimate way to both cover and assert-correct that
      lazily-evaluated config.
      CI: re-added the `postgres:16-alpine` service (removed in 0.5 because
      nothing needed it yet) and a `Migrate test database` step
      (`npm run db:migrate`) before `Test with coverage`, exactly as 0.5's
      NOTE anticipated.
      NOTE: `scripts/db-migrate.mjs` (not `src/lib/db/migrate.ts`) is the
      `db:migrate` CLI entry point — deliberately outside `src/lib`, alongside
      the existing `scripts/coverage-summary.mjs`, so it's outside vitest's
      `coverage.include: ["src/**"]` the same structural way `*.config.*`
      files already are. The alternative (a `src/lib/db/migrate.ts` with a
      testable-function/CLI-guard split) was tried first, but the CLI-guard
      branch itself would never be exercised under vitest, and mocking `pg` + drizzle's `migrate()` to cover a 10-line wrapper is exactly the "test
      that asserts nothing" AGENT.md warns against — the real proof that
      migrations work is `schema.test.ts` running against a database that
      script actually migrated. This is also why `tsx` (installed to run a
      `.ts` migration script directly) was removed again — `.mjs` needs no
      transpilation.
      NOTE for 1.2 (local dev database): the `docker-compose.yml` +
      `db:reset` task still needs doing — this iteration proved the
      migrate/rollback/reapply cycle by hand against an ad hoc
      `docker run postgres:16-alpine` container (removed after), not a
      committed compose file. Local dev and any future manual verification
      needs that container brought up by hand until 1.2 lands.
      NOTE for 1.3+ (repos): `schema.test.ts`'s afterEach cleanup pattern
      (delete children before parents, by collected id, rather than
      transaction-rollback) is there because drizzle's `db.transaction`
      requires catching a rollback-marker error thrown by `tx.rollback()`,
      which added noise for little benefit at this scale — reconsider if
      1.3's repo integration tests get numerous enough that manual cleanup
      becomes the bigger noise source.
      NOTE — flagging, not guessing: the fix_plan bullet above named a
      `customers` table, but `specs/02-data-model.md` never defines one —
      only `orders` (with a plain `email` column) and a standalone
      `addresses` table. Implemented the spec as written. If a real
      `customers` table (e.g. for repeat-customer history or accounts) is
      wanted, that needs a spec update first, not a schema guess.

- [x] **1.2 Local dev database**
      Deps: 1.1. `docker-compose.yml` — single `postgres:16-alpine` service,
      `POSTGRES_USER=user`/`POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass`/`POSTGRES_DB=fhc` to match
      `.env.example`'s `DATABASE_URL`, port `5432:5432`, named volume
      (`fhc_postgres_data`) so data survives `docker compose down` (not `-v`),
      healthcheck via `pg_isready`.
      `scripts/db-reset.mjs` — new CLI script alongside `db-migrate.mjs`
      (same rationale: outside `src/lib`, outside the coverage gate, no logic
      beyond gluing `pg`+drizzle calls together). Connects to the `postgres`
      admin database (derived from `DATABASE_URL` by swapping the path),
      terminates other backends on the target db, `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS` +
      `CREATE DATABASE`, then runs the same `migrate()` call as
      `db-migrate.mjs`. Added `"db:reset": "node scripts/db-reset.mjs"`.
      `tests/unit/docker-compose.test.ts` (2 tests, `ci-config.test.ts`
      pattern — regex assertions against the real files, not a YAML parser
      dependency): `docker-compose.yml` exists and its image/port/env vars
      match `.env.example`'s `DATABASE_URL`; `package.json`'s `db:reset`
      script points at a script file that actually exists. Confirmed both
      fail for the right reason (file/script missing) before implementing.
      AC met, verified live: `docker compose up -d postgres`, waited for
      the healthcheck, ran `npm run db:reset` twice in a row — ~1.1s each
      time (well under 10s), first run produced all 15 tables + view
      empty, second run (against an already-migrated db) was equally fast
      and left it empty again. Also ran the full `npm run verify` gate
      against the running container: 33 tests, 100% coverage, build green.
      `docker compose down` afterward to leave no container running between
      iterations; the named volume persists (by design — `down` without
      `-v`) so the next `docker compose up` starts from where this one left
      off rather than a surprise empty volume.
      NOTE: this sandbox has a working `docker`/`docker compose` CLI
      (v29.6.2) — 1.1's NOTE about proving migrations "by hand" with an ad
      hoc container is now superseded; use `docker compose up -d postgres`
      going forward instead of a bare `docker run`.
      NOTE: CI's `postgres` service (added in 1.1, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
      is independent of this compose file — it uses different credentials
      (`postgres`/`postgres`/`fhc_test`) and is provisioned directly by
      GitHub Actions' `services:` block, not docker-compose. No change needed
      there; `docker-compose.yml` is local-dev-only per `specs/08-deploy-ops.md`.

- [x] **1.3 Repository layer**
      Deps: 1.1. `src/lib/repos/*` — the only modules that import Drizzle.
      Typed CRUD for products, variants, orders, inventory.
      AC: every repo function has an integration test against the dev database.
      Repos ≥85% covered.
      Split into sub-tasks below (one repo module is a full task on its own —
      each needs its own integration-test file against the real dev database).
      This umbrella item is ticked `[x]` only once all four below are `[x]`.

  - [x] **1.3a Products repo**
        Deps: 1.1. `src/lib/repos/products.ts` — createProduct, getProductById,
        getProductBySlug, listProducts (optional `{status?, includeDeleted?}`,
        excludes soft-deleted by default), updateProduct, softDeleteProduct
        (sets `deletedAt` + `updatedAt`, does not hard-delete).
        `src/lib/repos/products.test.ts` — 9 integration tests against the
        real dev database (create default-draft, getById found/not-found,
        getBySlug, list filtered by status excluding soft-deleted, list with
        no filter across statuses, list with `includeDeleted: true`, update,
        soft-delete keeps the row retrievable by id with `deletedAt` set).
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on
        `products.ts` alone; full `npm run verify` green (42 tests, 100%
        global coverage, build passes).
        NOTE — env vars for local test runs: neither `vitest.config.mts` nor
        any npm script loads `.env.local` into `process.env` (confirmed by
        running `schema.test.ts` cold — it fails the same env-parse error
        this task's test did until `.env.local` is exported by hand). CI works
        because `ci.yml` sets the vars directly in the `env:` block. Local
        runs against the dev database need
        `set -a; source .env.local; set +a` (or equivalent) before
        `vitest`/`npm run test:coverage`. Future repo-layer iterations (1.3b–d)
        hit this same wall — this note is here so they don't re-discover it.
        NOTE for 1.3b: `softDeleteProduct`/`updateProduct` both stamp
        `updatedAt: new Date()` explicitly rather than relying on the
        column's `defaultNow()` (which only fires on insert, not update) —
        the same pattern will be needed for any other table with an
        `updated_at` column.

  - [x] **1.3b Variants repo**
        Deps: 1.3a. `src/lib/repos/variants.ts` — createVariant, getVariantById,
        listVariantsByProductId (all variants, active or not — used by admin),
        listActiveVariantsByProductId (storefront-facing, filters
        `isActive = true` in SQL), updateVariant, deactivateVariant
        (`isActive = false`, no hard delete — variants are referenced by
        `order_items`). Mirrors `products.ts`'s shape exactly (typed
        `$inferSelect`/`$inferInsert`, `returning()` after
        insert/update, `[x]!` non-null assertion on the single-row insert
        result).
        `src/lib/repos/variants.test.ts` — 7 integration tests against the
        real dev database (create, getById found/not-found, list all for a
        product, active-only list excludes a deactivated variant, update,
        deactivate keeps the row retrievable with `isActive: false`).
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on the repo
        module alone; full `npm run verify` green (9 files, 49 tests, 100%
        global coverage, build passes). Confirmed the test file fails for the
        right reason (import resolution error, module doesn't exist) before
        writing `variants.ts`.
        NOTE: unlike `products`, `product_variants` has no `updated_at`
        column in the schema (see `specs/02-data-model.md`'s field list), so
        `updateVariant`/`deactivateVariant` do NOT stamp a timestamp the way
        1.3a's NOTE for products does — don't copy that pattern here by
        reflex for 1.3c/1.3d without checking each table's actual columns
        first.

  - [x] **1.3c Inventory repo**
        Deps: 1.3b. `src/lib/repos/inventory.ts` — recordMovement (insert into
        `inventory_movements`), getStockForVariant (reads `variant_stock`
        view, returns 0 for a variant with no rows per `specs/02-data-model.md`),
        getStockForVariants (batch, for a listing page — pre-seeds every
        requested id with 0 in the returned `Map` before merging in the
        view's rows, so callers never have to special-case a missing key
        for "no movements yet" the way they would with the raw view).
        `src/lib/repos/inventory.test.ts` — 5 integration tests against the
        real dev database (record a movement, sum of positive+negative
        deltas via `getStockForVariant`, zero-movements variant reads as 0,
        batch lookup across three variants including one with zero
        movements, empty-array batch returns an empty `Map`). Confirmed red
        first (import resolution error, module doesn't exist) before writing
        `inventory.ts`.
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on the repo
        module alone; full `npm run verify` green (10 files, 54 tests, 100%
        global coverage, build passes).
        NOTE: `getStockForVariants` guards the empty-array case explicitly —
        drizzle's `inArray(col, [])` compiles to `IN ()`, which Postgres
        rejects as invalid syntax. Any future batch-lookup repo function
        built on `inArray` needs the same empty-input guard.

  - [x] **1.3d Orders repo**
        Deps: 1.3b. `src/lib/repos/orders.ts` — createOrder(order, items)
        (order + order_items in one `db.transaction`), getOrderById,
        getOrderByStripeSessionId, listOrdersByStatus, updateOrder (patch —
        status transitions, `paidAt`/`fulfilledAt` are just fields on the
        patch, no separate transition function).
        `src/lib/repos/orders.test.ts` — 8 integration tests against the real
        dev database: create-with-items (asserts the returned order and that
        `order_items` rows exist with the right `orderId`), the atomicity
        test (an item with a `variantId` that doesn't exist in
        `product_variants` violates the FK inside the transaction — asserts
        `createOrder(...)` rejects, then that neither the order — looked up
        by its unique `stripeSessionId` — nor the item — looked up by a
        unique `skuSnapshot` marker, since the failed insert never returns an
        id to key off — persisted), getById found/not-found,
        getByStripeSessionId found/not-found, listByStatus (filters paid vs.
        pending), update (status + both timestamp fields in two successive
        patches). Confirmed red first by moving `orders.ts` aside — the test
        failed on import resolution, not a runtime error — then restored it.
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on the repo
        module; full `npm run verify` green (11 files, 62 tests, 100% global
        coverage, build passes).
        NOTE: `orderItems.variantId` is nullable (a variant may be deleted
        later — see the spec's snapshot-column rationale), so Postgres only
        enforces the FK when a value is actually provided. The atomicity test
        exploits exactly this: it must pass a non-null-but-nonexistent uuid
        to get a real FK violation, since passing `null` would insert
        successfully and prove nothing about rollback.
        NOTE: no `getOrderItemsByOrderId` (or any order-items reader) exists
        yet — out of scope per the fix_plan bullet, which lists only the five
        order-level functions above. 3.5 (order creation + inventory
        decrement) or 4.6 (orders dashboard) will need one; add it there, not
        here, as a repo-import fix if items are needed before then instead of
        guessing at a shape now.

- [x] **1.4 Seed + CSV catalog importer**
      Deps: 1.3. Importer reads the Shopify product CSV export into the schema —
      handles variants, images, tags→categories, and per-variant SKU/price.
      Dry-run mode prints a diff and changes nothing.
      AC: importing the real export produces the correct product/variant counts;
      malformed rows are reported, not silently dropped; unit tests cover missing
      columns, duplicate SKUs, and non-numeric prices.
      🚦 HUMAN GATE — confirm the parsed catalog before the first non-dry-run.
      Split into sub-tasks below (parse/validate is pure and independently
      testable from the DB-writing/diff side, same rationale as 1.3's split).
      This umbrella item is ticked `[x]` only once both below are `[x]`.

  - [x] **1.4a CSV parser + validation**
        Deps: 1.3. `src/lib/services/catalog-importer.ts` — pure, DB-free
        `parseShopifyCsv(csvText)` using the `csv-parse` package (added as a
        dependency; RFC 4180 quoting/embedded-comma/newline handling is
        exactly what a hand-rolled split(",") gets wrong, and `Body (HTML)`
        routinely contains commas). Rows are grouped by `Handle` via a
        `Map` (insertion order = output order); the first row seen for a
        handle carries product-level fields (`Title`, `Body (HTML)`, `Tags`
        → `categories`), later rows with the same handle add variants and/or
        images and leave product-level columns blank — matching Shopify's
        real export shape.
        Required columns: `Handle`, `Title`, `Variant SKU`, `Variant Price`,
        `Variant Grams` (the last because `product_variants.weight_grams` is
        `NOT NULL` with no default per `specs/02-data-model.md`). Missing
        required columns are a whole-file error (`row: 0, handle: null`,
        one entry per missing column) and abort parsing — a header problem
        invalidates every row, so partial output would be misleading.
        Row-level problems (blank `Handle`, blank `Title` on a new handle,
        duplicate SKU anywhere in the file, non-numeric `Variant
Price`/`Variant Compare At Price`/`Variant Grams`) are collected into
        an `errors: ImportRowError[]` array with a 1-based data-row number
        and the offending handle; the row/variant is skipped, not thrown,
        and parsing continues — this is what "malformed rows are reported,
        not silently dropped" means in practice; 1.4b decides whether any
        errors should block a real `--apply` run.
        A row with a blank `Variant SKU` but a non-empty `Handle` is treated
        as an image-only continuation row (real Shopify exports use these to
        attach extra product images without adding a variant), not an error.
        `src/lib/services/catalog-importer.test.ts` — 12 unit tests: a
        well-formed multi-variant/multi-image product, every missing-required-
        column case at once, duplicate SKU (second occurrence dropped, first
        kept), non-numeric price/compare-at-price/weight (each skips only
        that variant), blank Handle, blank Title on a new handle, an
        image-only continuation row, a minimal CSV containing only the five
        required columns (proves optional-column-absent files still parse),
        a CSV missing only `Image Alt Text` (defaults to `""`), and the
        empty-catalog case. Confirmed red first (import resolution error,
        module didn't exist) before writing `catalog-importer.ts`.
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on the module
        (exceeds the 90% `src/lib/services/**` floor); full `npm run verify`
        green (12 files, 74 tests, 100% global coverage, build passes).
        NOTE for 1.4b: `raw[column]!.trim()` (non-null assertion) is used for
        the five required columns, not `?.trim() ?? ""` — after the header
        check confirms they exist, and because `csv-parse` rejects any data
        row whose column count doesn't match the header (confirmed: a short
        row throws `Invalid Record Length`, it doesn't silently pad with
        `undefined`), those keys are runtime-guaranteed strings despite
        `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` typing bare indexed access as possibly
        `undefined`. The `?.trim() ?? ""` / `|| null` pattern is kept only for
        genuinely optional columns (`Tags`, `Body (HTML)`, `Option1/2/3
Value`, `Variant Compare At Price`, `Image Src`, `Image Position`,
        `Image Alt Text`) that a minimal export may omit entirely.
        NOTE for 1.4b: `parseShopifyCsv` does not enforce "every product has
        at least one variant" (a spec-level expectation, not a DB
        constraint) — a product whose only variant row had a parse error
        comes back with `variants: []`. 1.4b's diff/apply step must decide
        whether to skip such a product or surface it as blocking, not assume
        the array is non-empty.
        NOTE for 1.4b: `slug` is derived as `handle.toLowerCase()` — Shopify
        handles are already URL-safe/hyphenated, so no further slugify step
        was needed. If a future non-Shopify source feeds this parser, that
        assumption would need revisiting.

  - [x] **1.4b Dry-run diff + apply + seed CLI**
        Deps: 1.4a. `src/lib/services/catalog-import.ts` — `runCatalogImport
(parsedProducts, {apply})` diffs parsed products against the
        current catalog (product by slug, each variant by SKU, via the
        products/variants repos) into per-product/per-variant
        `create`/`update`/`unchanged` actions; dry-run (`apply: false`)
        only reads and reports, `apply: true` writes everything inside one
        transaction. `scripts/import-catalog.mts` — CLI wrapper (`npm run
import-catalog -- <file.csv> [--apply]`, dry-run is the default,
        prints row errors then the diff/apply summary).
        `ParsedVariant` (1.4a) gained a `stockQuantity` field — parsed from
        the optional `Variant Inventory Qty` column, defaulting to `0` — so
        `applyCatalogImport` has something to write into the mandatory
        `import`-reason `inventory_movements` row for every newly created
        variant (not re-written on re-apply, so stock doesn't double-count).
        Two new repos, `src/lib/repos/categories.ts` (`getCategoryBySlug`,
        `createCategory`, `linkProductCategory` — `onConflictDoNothing` on
        the composite PK for idempotent re-linking) and
        `src/lib/repos/images.ts` (`replaceProductImages` — delete-then-
        reinsert per product, since `product_images` has no natural upsert
        key). Product images are written with `width`/`height` hardcoded to
        `0` — the CSV carries no real dimensions; that's 4.5's job when it
        actually fetches/processes the image bytes. See
        `specs/02-data-model.md`'s "Implementation notes (1.4b)" for full
        detail, including how the transaction crosses `products.ts`/
        `variants.ts`/`inventory.ts`/`categories.ts`/`images.ts` while
        keeping "only repos import `db`" (AGENT.md) intact via a new
        `DbExecutor` type + optional `executor` param threaded through each
        repo function, and a `src/lib/repos/transaction.ts` helper
        (`withTransaction`) so the service never imports `db` itself.
        `tsx` added as an explicit `devDependency` (previously only
        transitive, via `vite`/`drizzle-kit`) to run the `.mts` CLI, since
        reimplementing the parser/diff logic in plain JS would have
        duplicated already-tested code — the one thing this loop's own
        instructions call out as the most common failure mode.
        AC met (partially — see gate below): `src/lib/services/catalog-
import.test.ts` (5 integration tests against the real dev
        database) proves create/update/unchanged actions, that dry-run
        writes nothing, and — the AC's actual idempotency requirement —
        that applying the same parsed input twice produces no duplicate
        product/variant/category-link/image/inventory-movement rows the
        second time. Also hand-verified end-to-end with the CLI against a
        synthetic CSV (dry-run → apply → re-apply), see
        `specs/02-data-model.md`. `npm run verify` green: 90 tests,
        `catalog-import.ts` at 97.5%/94.87%/100%/97.36%
        (stmts/branches/funcs/lines), comfortably above the 90%
        `src/lib/services/**` floor.
        🚦 HUMAN GATE — CLOSED 2026-07-22. The owner supplied the
        starting catalog as `tests/fixtures/catalog.csv` and confirmed it
        as the data to import. Dry-run inspected first, then
        `npm run import-catalog -- tests/fixtures/catalog.csv --apply`
        run against the local dev database: 5 products / 45 variants /
        45 import-reason inventory movements — exactly matching the CSV
        (9 scents × 5 product types: shampoo-bar, conditioner-bar, soap,
        8oz-candle, 8oz-body-butter). Zero row errors. The dev DB was
        `db:reset` first because it held 41 stale products (94 variants)
        from an older, superseded fixture (bundle/"copy-of-" slugs from
        2.2-era verification) — a clean import was the only way to make
        counts assertable. Re-ran the full `npm run verify` gate against
        the imported data: 30 files, 244 tests, 99.14% coverage, build
        green.
        NOTE — discovered during the real import, logged as task 1.5:
        all 5 products imported as `status = 'draft'` even though the
        CSV's `Status` column says `active` and `Published` says `true` —
        the importer never reads those columns. Until 1.5 lands (or an
        admin publishes them via 4.3), the storefront listing renders an
        empty state against this otherwise-correct catalog.

- [x] **1.5 Importer honors CSV `Status`/`Published` columns**
      Deps: 1.4b. Discovered during the first real `--apply` (2026-07-22):
      `parseShopifyCsv` ignored the `Status`/`Published` columns, so every
      imported product landed as `draft` and the storefront showed an empty
      catalog against a correct import.
      `ParsedProduct` gained `status: ParsedProductStatus`
      (`draft | published | archived`), derived on the first row per handle
      by a new `parseStatus` helper: `archived` → `archived`;
      `active` → `published` **unless** `Published` is literally `false`
      (Shopify keeps them as separate columns and `Published: false` +
      `Status: active` means "not on the online channel" — resolved to
      `draft`, the safe direction); anything else (missing column, blank,
      unknown value) → `draft`, permissive-parse convention, never a row
      error. `catalog-import.ts`: `productChanged` now compares `status`,
      and both the create and update paths write `parsed.status` — so a
      status-only change diffs as `update`, and re-importing after an admin
      unpublishes WILL republish (CSV wins; the importer is a full-sync
      tool, consistent with how it already overwrites name/description).
      Tests: 4 new parser cases (active+true → published; draft/archived
      passthrough; active+Published:false → draft; missing/blank/unknown →
      draft) and 2 new integration cases (create writes parsed status;
      status-only change reports and applies `update`) — all confirmed red
      first (`status` undefined / action `unchanged`) before implementing.
      AC met, verified live: re-ran `npm run import-catalog --
tests/fixtures/catalog.csv --apply` — all 5 products diffed `[update]`
      and flipped to `published` (psql-confirmed), and a real `next dev` +
      `curl /products` rendered all 5 product cards (each "Out of stock" —
      correct, the CSV has no `Variant Inventory Qty` column, so initial
      import movements are delta 0). `npm run verify` green: 30 files, 250
      tests, 99.15/96.44/100/99.12% coverage, build passes.
      NOTE for 4.4 (inventory management): the catalog is live but every
      variant has 0 stock — real starting counts need either a manual
      `inventory_movements` adjustment (admin UI, 4.4) or a future CSV with
      `Variant Inventory Qty` populated. Nothing is sellable until then,
      which is fine pre-checkout (cart is 2.7, payments are phase 3).

- [x] **1.6 Importer populates filter facets (attributes + categories)**
      Deps: 1.5. `ParsedProduct` (1.4a, `catalog-importer.ts`) gained
      `attributes: ParsedAttribute[]` (`{key, value}`). `OptionN Name`
      appears once per product (its first CSV row, alongside Title/Tags —
      confirmed against the real fixture, not assumed); `OptionN Value`
      repeats per variant row. Parsing keeps two handle-keyed maps
      alongside `productsByHandle`: `optionNamesByHandle` (captured once,
      on product creation, lowercased) and `seenAttributesByHandle` (a
      `Set<"key::value">` per handle) so the same key/value pair seen
      across multiple variant rows (e.g. two SKUs that both come in
      "Balsam Fir") is recorded once, not once per row. (b) category
      fallback: `product.categories` now falls back to `[Type]` when
      `Tags` is blank; `Tags` still wins when present (unchanged from
      before). Both changes are parser-only (pure, no DB) — 1.4b's
      diff/apply layer was untouched for status logic, only extended.
      `src/lib/repos/attributes.ts` gained `replaceProductAttributes`
      (delete-then-reinsert per product id), mirroring `images.ts`'s
      `replaceProductImages` exactly — `product_attributes` has no natural
      upsert key, and replace-not-diff is what makes a changed option
      value (not just a repeated one) idempotent too, not only an
      unchanged one. `catalog-import.ts`'s `importProduct` calls it
      unconditionally on `apply && product`, in the same block as
      `replaceProductImages`, so attributes remain in sync with the parsed
      input on every apply regardless of the product/variant `action`
      classification (create/update/unchanged) — matching how images
      already behave, not a new pattern.
      Tests: 4 new parser cases (dedup across repeated values, a second
      independent `OptionN` pair, `Type` fallback when `Tags` is blank,
      `Tags` wins when both present) plus an `attributes: []` assertion
      added to the existing minimal-CSV case; 2 new `catalog-import.ts`
      integration cases (apply writes attribute rows, re-import with a
      changed value replaces rather than accumulates) plus assertions
      added to the existing create/re-apply-unchanged cases. All confirmed
      red first (missing `attributes` field / no rows written) before
      implementing.
      AC met, verified live against the real dev database: re-ran
      `npm run import-catalog -- tests/fixtures/catalog.csv --apply`
      (all 5 products `[unchanged]`, since this only added facet data);
      `listFilterableAttributeValues("scent")` returns exactly the 9 real
      scents; `listFilterableCategories()` returns `Body Butter, Hair
Care, Soap, candles` — 4 categories, matching the AC's "4 product
      types" (the `Type` value `Candles` slugifies to `candles`, which
      collided with a category of that same slug/lower-name already
      created by an earlier iteration's `catalog-import.test.ts` runs —
      pre-existing stale data unrelated to this task's code, not a bug:
      `getCategoryBySlug` correctly found and reused it instead of
      creating a duplicate). Ran the apply a second time immediately
      after: `product_attributes` row count held at 45 and
      `product_categories` link count held at 5 — no duplicates.
      `npm run verify` green: 30 files, 260 tests, 98.8/96.15/100/98.75%
      coverage, build passes.
      NOTE: while running `verify`, lint failed on a stray `.open-next/`
      directory (26MB, gitignored, produced by `npm run preview`/`deploy`
      — task 6.0's Cloudflare Workers adapter — but never added to
      `eslint.config.mjs`'s `globalIgnores`). This wasn't caused by 1.6's
      changes but blocked its AC (`npm run verify` must pass), so it's
      fixed in this commit: `.open-next/**` added to `globalIgnores`
      (matching the existing `.next/**`/`out/**`/`build/**` pattern) and
      the stray directory deleted (regenerable via `npm run preview`, not
      committed work). Any future iteration that runs `preview`/`deploy`
      locally will hit this again if it doesn't know to `rm -rf
.open-next` first — now it won't, since lint ignores it.
      NOTE for later cleanup (not blocking, low priority): the stale
      `candles`/`seasonal` categories mentioned above come from
      `catalog-import.test.ts`'s `afterEach`, which deletes
      `product_categories` link rows (via the parent product's cascade)
      but never the `categories` rows themselves — every local test run
      against the dev DB leaves orphaned category rows behind. Harmless
      today (`listFilterableCategories` only returns categories with a
      live published-product link), but worth a follow-up if the category
      table ever needs a uniqueness/cleanup pass.

- [x] **1.7 Made-to-order / oversell support** (owner request, 2026-07-22)
      Deps: 1.3. The shop has no supply yet and wants to sell anyway,
      producing to order — sold-out products stay published and purchasable.
      Two additive columns (migration `0001_mixed_molly_hayes.sql`, applied
      to local dev; expand/contract-safe): `product_variants.allow_backorder`
      (boolean NOT NULL default **true** — everything is made-to-order until
      the owner turns it off per variant) and `order_items.oversold_quantity`
      (integer NOT NULL default 0 — how much of the line exceeded on-hand
      stock at order time; checkout (3.5) must compute
      `max(0, quantity - available)` when it decrements inventory).
      `listPublishedProductsFiltered` gained a `purchasable` aggregate
      (`bool_or(stock > 0 OR allow_backorder)`) alongside the untouched
      literal `inStock`; `ProductListingItem`/`ProductDetailVariant` carry
      `purchasable`/`allowBackorder` through. UI: card + variant selector
      show **"Made to order"** (neutral styling) for zero-stock backorderable
      items, "Out of stock" only when backorder is off; the "In stock only"
      filter stays literal (made-to-order ≠ in stock) — decided so the label
      never lies; revisit if the owner wants it to mean "available to buy".
      Tests: 2 new repo integration cases (purchasable vs inStock,
      literal filter), service passthrough assertions, 1 orders-repo case
      (oversold_quantity persists; default 0 asserted in the existing create
      test), 2 card + 1 selector RTL cases. `specs/02-data-model.md` updated.
      `npm run verify` green: 30 files, 255 tests, 98.95% coverage, build ok.
      NOTE for 3.4/3.5 (checkout): purchasability gate = stock > 0 OR
      allow_backorder; a sale may drive ledger stock negative — that's legal
      now. Order confirmation email (3.7) should probably tell the customer
      the item is made to order — decide lead-time copy with the owner.

## Phase 2 — Storefront

- [x] **2.1 Design tokens + layout shell**
      Deps: 0.1. Tailwind v4 keeps tokens in CSS, not a `tailwind.config.ts` —
      `src/app/globals.css`'s `:root`/`@theme inline` blocks now define a
      brand palette (`cream`/`ink`/`clay`/`clay-dark`/`sage`/`sand`) generating
      `bg-cream`, `text-ink`, `bg-clay`, etc. utilities. **These are placeholder
      values** (warm neutrals + a terracotta accent, picked to fit "handmade
      candles + body butter" without real brand input) — everything downstream
      is built against the semantic names, not the hex codes, so swapping in
      the owner's real logo/palette later is a one-file edit, not a rebuild.
      See the "Blocked" entry below, updated to reflect this. Removed the
      scaffold's OS-`prefers-color-scheme` dark-mode flip — a single fixed
      brand palette, not an adaptive one, is the right call for a storefront
      with a defined identity. Type scale/spacing: reused Tailwind v4's default
      scale rather than inventing custom values; nothing in the spec calls for
      a non-default scale yet.
      New `src/components/site-header.tsx` (logo linking `/`, `<nav
aria-label="Main">` with Shop/About/Contact, a `/cart` link whose
      `aria-label` carries a hardcoded `Cart, 0 items` — real count wiring is
      2.7's job, this just proves the indicator slot exists) and
      `src/components/site-footer.tsx` (`<nav aria-label="Policies">` with all
      seven policy links from `specs/03-storefront.md`'s route list). Both are
      plain Server Components (no interactivity yet, so no `"use client"`).
      Wired into `src/app/layout.tsx` around `{children}`, which is now wrapped
      in the page's single `<main>` landmark — moved `src/app/page.tsx`'s own
      top-level element from `<main>` to a `<div>` so pages don't nest a second
      `<main>` inside the layout's.
      `site-header.test.tsx` / `site-footer.test.tsx` (7 RTL tests total):
      logo href, nav landmark + link hrefs, cart indicator accessible name,
      every policy link, and an axe (`jest-axe`) zero-violations assertion per
      component. Confirmed red first (import-resolution error, components
      didn't exist).
      Added `jest-axe` + `@types/jest-axe` as devDependencies. `tests/setup.ts`
      now also calls `expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)` and, importantly,
      registers `afterEach(cleanup)` from `@testing-library/react` — without
      it, `vitest.config.mts` not setting `test.globals: true` meant RTL's
      auto-cleanup detection didn't kick in, so every test after the first in
      a file left its rendered tree in `document.body`, which made later
      `getByRole` queries match stale duplicates and made axe report
      `landmark-no-duplicate-banner`. This will matter for every future
      component test file, not just these two.
      AC met for the "renders at 360/768/1440 with no horizontal scroll" half
      via a real browser, not jsdom (jsdom has no layout engine to assert
      against): installed Playwright's Chromium (`npx playwright install
chromium`; `--with-deps` failed, no passwordless sudo in this sandbox,
      but the browser-only download didn't need it), ran the dev server, and
      measured `document.documentElement.scrollWidth` vs `clientWidth` at all
      three widths — equal (no overflow) at each, screenshots visually
      confirmed the header/footer wrap sanely with no clipped content.
      Also fixed a pre-existing, unrelated failure hit while running
      `npm run verify`: `tests/unit/docker-compose.test.ts`'s
      `db:reset`-script-exists regex (`/node\s+(\S+\.mjs)/`) predated
      aeaecb4's `node --env-file=.env.local scripts/db-reset.mjs` change and
      no longer matched with the flag in between — confirmed this was already
      broken on `main` before this task (same failure on `git stash`), fixed
      the regex to tolerate `--flag` tokens between `node` and the script
      path rather than touching the flag itself.
      Full `npm run verify` green: 17 files, 97 tests, 99.57%/98.36%/100%/
      99.56% coverage (global 80% floor, 90% floor for services — both clear),
      build passes.

- [x] **2.2 All-products page**
      Deps: 1.3, 2.1. `src/app/(storefront)/products/page.tsx` — async Server
      Component, `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (catalog/stock
      change independently of deploys per AGENT.md's "database is the source
      of truth for catalog and inventory" — without this the route got
      statically prerendered at build time, confirmed by `next build`'s
      route table showing `○ /products` before the fix and `ƒ /products`
      after; a real bug caught by actually reading `npm run build` output,
      not just green tests).
      New service `src/lib/services/product-listing.ts` —
      `getPublishedProductListing()`: three queries total regardless of
      catalog size (products, batch active-variants-by-product-ids, batch
      primary-images-by-product-ids) plus a batch stock lookup via the
      existing `getStockForVariants` — never N+1 per product. Computes
      `priceFromCents` (min active-variant price, `null` if none) and
      `inStock` (any active variant with summed stock > 0) per product.
      Two new batch repo functions, following the existing
      `getStockForVariants` "absent key = zero/none" convention: `src/lib/
repos/variants.ts`'s `listActiveVariantsByProductIds` and `src/lib/repos/
images.ts`'s `listPrimaryImagesByProductIds` (uses `db.selectDistinctOn`,
      not a method on the query object — this drizzle version
      (`0.45.2`) exposes it only as `db.selectDistinctOn([cols]).from(...)`,
      confirmed by inspecting the built package since the typed `.d.ts`
      chain has no `.distinct()`/`.distinctOn()` instance method).
      `src/lib/repos/products.ts`'s `listProducts` now orders
      `desc(createdAt)` by default (newest-first, matching the spec's
      default `sort=newest` and the `products_status_created_at_idx` index
      that already existed for exactly this) — additive, doesn't break any
      existing `toContain`-style test.
      New pure util `src/lib/format.ts` — `formatPriceCents` (`Intl.
NumberFormat` cents→`"$19.99"`), and two presentational components:
      `src/components/product-card.tsx` (image or "No image" placeholder,
      name linking `/products/[slug]`, price-from, "Out of stock" label) and
      `src/components/product-grid.tsx` (renders a `<ul>` of cards or an
      empty-state message — the spec's "every list has an empty state").
      Plain `<img>`, not `next/image` — no image hosting/remote-pattern
      config exists yet (real R2 hosting is 4.5's job, `next/image` sizing
      is 5.4's); an `eslint-disable` on that line names both.
      Tests: `product-listing.test.ts` (6 integration tests against the real
      dev database — excludes draft/archived, price-from ignores deactivated
      variants, out-of-stock/in-stock via real `inventory_movements` rows,
      no-variants product has `null` price and is out-of-stock, primary
      image by lowest position or `null`), `format.test.ts` (3 unit tests),
      `product-card.test.tsx` / `product-grid.test.tsx` (12 RTL tests
      including `jest-axe`), `products/page.test.tsx` (2 tests — an async
      Server Component is invoked and awaited directly,
      `render(await ProductsPage())`, then asserted with RTL like any other
      component; this is the pattern future storefront route tests should
      follow), plus new batch-function tests in `variants.test.ts`/
      `images.test.ts`/`products.test.ts`. Confirmed every new test red for
      the right reason (import-resolution or assertion failure against
      not-yet-written code) before implementing.
      AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above, and a real browser —
      seeded the dev DB via `npm run import-catalog -- tests/fixtures/
catalog.csv --apply` (all rows import as `draft` by default), published
      three products directly in Postgres, ran `next dev`, and used
      Playwright's CLI screenshot (`npx playwright screenshot`) against
      `localhost:3000/products`: the three published products rendered with
      name/price-from/"Out of stock", the ~35 still-draft products (e.g.
      "Bar Soap", "Wax Melts") were absent from the HTML entirely (confirmed
      via `curl | grep`, not just visually), and adding a real
      `inventory_movements` row for one variant flipped its card from
      "Out of stock" to no badge on a second screenshot. Reverted both
      manual DB changes afterward. `npm run verify` green: 22 files, 125
      tests, 99.63%/97.94%/100%/99.63% global coverage (`product-listing.ts`
      itself 94/80/100/94 stmts/branch/funcs/lines — the one uncovered
      branch is the empty-catalog early return, not covered because
      asserting "zero published products" against a shared dev database that
      other test files write to would be flakiness bait, not a real test;
      the aggregate `src/lib/services/**` threshold, which is what the gate
      actually enforces, clears 90% easily), build passes.
      NOTE for 2.3: `getPublishedProductListing`'s three-query shape is the
      thing to extend with `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` for filter/sort/
      pagination, not replace — the batch-map pattern for variants/images/
      stock still applies once a `WHERE` clause narrows which products come
      back first.
      NOTE for 2.5/2.6: no product-detail route exists yet, so `ProductCard`
      links to `/products/[slug]` paths that 404 today — expected, that's
      2.5's job.

- [x] **2.3 Sort and filter**
      Deps: 2.2. See `specs/03-storefront.md`.
      New `src/lib/validation/product-filters.ts` — the first module in
      `src/lib/validation/` (named in AGENT.md's layout but unused until
      now). `parseProductFilters(raw)` turns Next's `searchParams` object
      into a fully-defaulted `ProductFilters`, permissively: unknown keys
      ignored, non-numeric/negative prices ignored, unknown `sort` falls
      back to `"newest"`, a repeated single-value param (e.g. two `sort`s)
      takes the first. `inStockOnly` is presence-only per the spec's Notes
      column — `?inStock=false` still counts as "on" because the UI only
      ever omits the param or sends `inStock=true`, it never sends
      `false`. `filtersToSearchParams(filters)` is the inverse — canonical
      query-string round-trip, used to build chip-removal/clear-filters
      links without any hand-assembled query strings.
      `src/lib/repos/products.ts`'s new `listPublishedProductsFiltered(filters)`
      does the actual SQL: one query, `products` LEFT JOIN a per-product
      aggregate subquery over active variants (`min(price_cents)` +
      `bool_or(stock > 0)`, the latter joined through the existing
      `variant_stock` view) for price-from/in-stock, plus one `EXISTS`
      condition per active facet (category via `product_categories` join,
      scent/size via `product_attributes` key/value) so different facets
      AND together (separate conditions) while values within one facet OR
      together (`inArray` inside a single EXISTS). Price range is
      deliberately **not** filtered against the aggregated minimum — a
      separate EXISTS on `product_variants` checks whether _any_ active
      variant's price falls in `[min, max]`, because a multi-variant
      product can have one variant in range and a cheaper one outside it
      (spec: "matches if any variant falls in the range"). This also means
      `minPrice > maxPrice` needs no special-cased branch: no variant can
      satisfy both bounds at once, so it naturally yields zero rows, not
      an error. Sort is `price_asc`/`price_desc` (on the aggregated
      min-price column) / `name_asc` / `newest` (default), always
      tie-broken on `products.id` for stable pagination ahead of 2.4.
      Two new repo helpers feed the filter UI's facet options, both scoped
      to published/non-deleted products so an empty facet never renders as
      a selectable-but-empty checkbox: `categories.ts`'s
      `listFilterableCategories()` and a new `src/lib/repos/attributes.ts`
      (`setProductAttribute`, `listFilterableAttributeValues(key)`) — the
      first repo module for `product_attributes`, which had none before
      this task.
      `product-listing.ts` service: replaced `getPublishedProductListing()`
      with `getFilteredProductListing(filters: ProductFilters)` (same
      two-query shape as before — filtered/sorted products, then one batch
      image lookup — collapsed from three queries since price-from/in-stock
      are now computed in the repo's SQL instead of a second batch call)
      plus a new `getFilterFacets()` (categories/scents/sizes in parallel).
      This is an extension of the existing 2.2 function per the loop's own
      "search before creating a sibling" rule, not a parallel
      implementation — the default-filters case (`parseProductFilters({})`)
      reproduces the old unfiltered/newest-first behavior exactly, and all
      of 2.2's existing service/page tests were migrated to call the new
      function rather than duplicated.
      UI: new `src/components/product-filters-form.tsx` — a plain
      `method="GET" action="/products"` `<form>`, no client JS at all.
      Checking a facet checkbox or clicking "Apply filters" is an ordinary
      browser navigation to a new query string, which is what makes filter
      state live entirely in the URL and keeps working with JS disabled.
      Wrapped in `<details open>` for the "Filter button with an active
      count" requirement — free keyboard/screen-reader toggle semantics
      with zero JS. Active filters render as removable chips (each an
      `<a>` to the current filter set minus that one value, computed via
      `filtersToSearchParams`) plus a "Clear all" link to `/products`.
      `products/page.tsx` now takes `searchParams: Promise<RawSearchParams>`
      (Next 15+'s async page props), parses it once, and passes the same
      `filters` object to both the form (to pre-check/pre-fill controls)
      and the service. `ProductGrid` gained optional `emptyMessage`/
      `emptyAction` props so the page can show "No products match your
      filters." + a working "Clear filters" link when filters produced zero
      results, vs. the generic "check back soon" message for a genuinely
      empty catalog — same component, two empty states, per the spec's
      distinct empty-state requirement.
      Tests: `product-filters.test.ts` (17 unit tests — defaults, single
      and repeated facet values, blank-value dropping, whole/fractional
      price parsing, invalid/negative price ignored, `inStock` presence
      semantics, every sort value plus unknown-sort fallback, unknown
      params ignored, round-trip serialization); `products.test.ts` gained
      19 integration tests on `listPublishedProductsFiltered` (draft/
      archived excluded, category alone, category OR'd across two values,
      scent alone, size alone, price range matching _any_ variant not just
      the cheapest, minPrice-only, maxPrice-only, inverted range → empty
      not an error, in-stock-only, category AND in-stock combined, all
      four sorts including tie-break-by-id and default, empty-result case,
      result shape); `attributes.test.ts` (4 new tests) and 1 new test in
      `categories.test.ts` for the two facet-option repo functions;
      `product-listing.test.ts` migrated plus 2 new tests (filters actually
      applied through the service, `getFilterFacets` shape);
      `product-filters-form.test.tsx` (11 RTL + axe tests: GET-form
      attributes, checkbox checked-state from current filters, price/
      in-stock/sort pre-fill, chip rendering and correct removal hrefs for
      every facet type, price-chip "any" label when only one bound is set,
      zero axe violations both with and without active filters);
      `product-grid.test.tsx` gained 1 test for the new empty-state props;
      `products/page.test.tsx` migrated to the async `searchParams` prop
      plus 3 new tests (category filter via real query params, filtered
      empty state with working clear-filters link, unknown param ignored).
      AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above (179 tests total,
      `npm run verify` green — 99.46/98.29/100/99.45%
      stmts/branch/funcs/lines, comfortably over both the 80% global and
      90% services floors), and a real `next dev` server hit with `curl`
      against seeded data — full listing showed all 3 seeded products,
      `?category=<slug>` narrowed to exactly the 2 linked ones, an unknown
      category slug produced the "No products match your filters." empty
      state with a working `/products` clear-filters link, and
      `?utm_source=newsletter` was silently ignored (still showed all 3).
      Scratch data removed from the dev DB afterward.
      NOTE — deferred, not part of this AC: the spec's UI section calls for
      a mobile **bottom sheet** (an overlay) vs. a **desktop sidebar** —
      two distinct layouts. This task ships one `<details>` disclosure at
      every viewport width instead (open by default, collapsible via its
      `<summary>`), because a real bottom-sheet-vs-sidebar split needs
      either client JS or duplicated markup gated by responsive `hidden`
      classes (rejected — duplicate `name="category"` inputs across two
      copies of the same form would double-submit and confuse assistive
      tech). If the owner wants the literal bottom-sheet interaction later,
      that's a follow-up task, not a gap in this one's AC (filter
      correctness, URL state, empty states, and accessibility are all met
      by the current markup).
      NOTE for 2.4 (pagination): `page` is in the spec's query-param table
      but deliberately not parsed by `product-filters.ts` yet — no
      pagination logic exists to consume it, and an unhandled param is
      already "ignored" by design. `filtersToSearchParams` is what 2.4
      should extend (not replace) for building page-link hrefs that
      preserve the active filters — same rationale as 2.2's NOTE about
      extending `getPublishedProductListing`'s query shape rather than
      replacing it, which is exactly what happened here.
      NOTE for later phases: `product-filters-form.tsx`'s price sort
      (`price_asc`/`price_desc`) orders by the aggregated `variant_agg.
priceFromCents`, which is `NULL` for a product with zero active
      variants. Postgres' default null-ordering (`NULLS LAST` for `ASC`,
      `NULLS FIRST` for `DESC`) means a no-variant product would jump to
      the _top_ of a `price_desc` listing — not wrong exactly (there's no
      real price to sort it by) but worth knowing if it ever looks like a
      bug in a real catalog with unfinished/variant-less draft-turned-
      published products.

- [x] **2.4 Pagination**
      Deps: 2.3. `src/lib/validation/product-filters.ts` gained
      `PRODUCTS_PAGE_SIZE = 24` and a `page` field on `ProductFilters`
      (1-based, default 1 — non-numeric/zero/negative/fractional all fall
      back to 1, same permissive-parsing convention as every other filter).
      `filtersToSearchParams` omits `page` when it's 1, matching how `sort`
      already omits its default.
      `src/lib/repos/products.ts`'s `listPublishedProductsFiltered` gained
      **`limit`/`offset`, not a `page` number** — deliberately a raw
      primitive, not pagination-aware itself. Omitting `limit` returns every
      match unpaginated (zero behavior change for any of the 19 pre-existing
      callers that never set it). The existing `desc(createdAt), asc(id)`-
      style tie-break (2.3) is what makes LIMIT/OFFSET pages stable.
      `src/lib/services/product-listing.ts`'s `getFilteredProductListing`
      changed return type from `ProductListingItem[]` to
      `{ items, hasNextPage }` (`ProductListingPage`) — it requests
      `limit: PRODUCTS_PAGE_SIZE + 1, offset: (filters.page - 1) *
PRODUCTS_PAGE_SIZE` from the repo and slices the extra row off itself
      to compute `hasNextPage` without a second COUNT query. All existing
      callers/tests migrated to destructure `.items`.
      New `src/components/product-pagination.tsx` — plain Prev/Next `<a>`
      links (no client JS), hrefs built via `filtersToSearchParams({
...filters, page: n })` so every active filter round-trips onto both
      links; renders nothing when there's only one page. Wired into
      `products/page.tsx` below `ProductGrid`.
      Tests: 6 new cases in `product-filters.test.ts` (page parsing/
      defaulting/serialization), 2 new repo tests in `products.test.ts`
      (LIMIT/OFFSET + id tie-break with 5 same-`createdAt` products scoped
      to a throwaway category so cross-file DB pollution can't affect it,
      plus an offset-defaults-to-0 case), 2 new service tests in
      `product-listing.test.ts` (`hasNextPage` false on a single page;
      `page` 2 with `PRODUCTS_PAGE_SIZE + 1` seeded rows proving the filter
      carries across pages and the boundary is exact), 6 new component
      tests in `product-pagination.test.tsx` (incl. axe), 1 new integration
      test in `products/page.test.tsx` (25 rows in a category, `?page=2`
      renders the 1 spillover item with a working, filter-preserving
      Previous link and no Next link).
      AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above, and a real
      `next dev` server — seeded 25 published products in a throwaway
      category via `docker exec psql`, confirmed page 1 shows 24 with a
      `Next` link to `...&page=2`, page 2 shows the 1 remaining item with a
      `Previous` link back to `...&category=...` (no `page` param, since
      page 1 is the default) and no `Next` link, and page 3 renders the
      normal "No products match your filters." empty state (not a crash) —
      each rendering the category filter correctly preserved. Scratch data
      removed from the dev DB afterward. `npm run verify` green: 26 files,
      199 tests, 99.49/98.41/100/99.47% coverage (products.ts and every
      touched service/component file at 100%), build passes,
      `/products` still `ƒ` (dynamic).
      NOTE — real bug caught mid-implementation, worth remembering: an
      earlier version of this task tried to reuse a single `pageSize` value
      for both the repo's LIMIT and its OFFSET-per-page math, passing
      `pageSize: PRODUCTS_PAGE_SIZE + 1` from the service to get the
      hasNextPage peek row "for free." That's wrong — offset needs to
      advance by the _real_ page size (24) while limit needs to be one
      larger (25), and a single shared value can't be both. It silently
      skipped an entire page's worth of rows on `page=2` (offset became
      `(2-1)*25=25` against a 25-row result set, returning nothing). Caught
      by the service-level pagination test, not the repo-level one — the
      repo tests passed explicit small `pageSize` values per page and never
      exercised the peek-trick's page-2 arithmetic. This is why the repo
      API ended up as raw `limit`/`offset` instead of `page`/`pageSize`:
      the primitive that can't silently conflate two different numbers is
      safer than the convenient one. If a future task adds `page`/`pageSize`
      sugar on top of the repo again, keep the peek's limit and the
      stride's offset computed from two independent size values, not one.
      NOTE — dev-DB pollution risk considered and mitigated: this repo's
      integration tests share one live dev database across
      concurrently-run vitest files (12 workers on this sandbox's CPU
      count), and the pre-2.4 filter/listing tests got away with `toContain`
      assertions against an _unpaginated_ result set regardless of what
      else was in the database at that instant. Pagination changes that —
      a LIMIT-24 query scoped to "all published products" could
      legitimately drop a test's own row off page 1 if enough _other_
      concurrently-running test files' published products momentarily
      outrank it in `desc(createdAt)` order. Every new pagination test
      above scopes its query to a throwaway category (or, for the two
      largest tests, accepts the O(25) product-creation cost) specifically
      so pagination correctness never depends on how many other published
      products exist elsewhere in the shared database at test time. Any
      future test against `listPublishedProductsFiltered`/
      `getFilteredProductListing` with an explicit `page`/`limit` should
      follow the same category-scoping pattern, not just `toContain`.

- [x] **2.5 Product detail page**
      Deps: 1.3, 2.1. `src/app/(storefront)/products/[slug]/page.tsx` — async
      Server Component, `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` (same
      rationale as 2.2's listing page; confirmed `ƒ` not `○` in `next
build`'s route table).
      New `src/lib/services/product-detail.ts` — `getProductDetail(slug)`
      returns `null` for anything the storefront shouldn't reach by a
      guessed URL (unknown slug, draft, archived, or soft-deleted — mirrors
      2.2/2.3's "published, non-deleted only" contract), otherwise the full
      product (description/ingredients/safetyInfo/careInfo verbatim from
      `products`), every active variant (sorted by `position`, each with
      live stock via the existing batch `getStockForVariants`), every image
      (new repo fn, see below), and every `product_attributes` row grouped
      by key into `Record<string, string[]>` (e.g. `{ scent: ["lavender"],
burn_time: ["40 hours"] }` — there is no dedicated `burn_time` column;
      candles that need one just get a `product_attributes` row with that
      key, same open-ended mechanism 2.3 already uses for `scent`/`size`).
      Two new repo functions, both following existing batch/single-item
      conventions: `src/lib/repos/images.ts`'s `listImagesByProductId`
      (single product, all images ordered by position — a gallery, unlike
      `listPrimaryImagesByProductIds`'s one-per-product batch lookup for
      listing cards) and `src/lib/repos/attributes.ts`'s
      `listAttributesByProductId` (every key/value for one product,
      unfiltered by key — unlike the existing
      `listFilterableAttributeValues(key)` which is scoped to one key
      across all products for the filter UI's facet options).
      New `src/components/product-gallery.tsx` (server, no JS) — every
      image is rendered at once (primary large, rest as a thumbnail row);
      no click-to-swap main-image interaction, since that would need client
      JS or duplicated markup and isn't required by the AC. Placeholder
      shown for a product with zero images.
      New `src/components/variant-selector.tsx` (`"use client"`) — the
      interactive half of the page. A `<form method="GET"
action={/products/[slug]}>` wrapping a `<select>` (pre-populated from
      the initially-selected variant, one `<option>` per active variant)
      plus an always-visible "Update" submit button — same progressive-
      enhancement pattern as `ProductFiltersForm` (2.3): the GET-form
      fallback isn't hidden behind a JS check, it's just also enhanced.
      Selecting a variant updates local React state (price, stock, shipping
      weight) instantly and calls `window.history.replaceState` to sync the
      `?variant=sku` URL — deliberately NOT `next/navigation`'s
      `router.replace`, which would re-fetch the RSC payload from the
      server and violate the "without a full reload" AC. A disabled
      "Add to cart" button is present (cart doesn't exist until 2.7) with a
      `title="Cart is coming soon"` — real wiring is 2.7's job, not
      guessed at here.
      `products/[slug]/page.tsx` reads `?variant=` server-side too (for the
      no-JS/first-paint case and for direct deep-links): looks up a
      matching active variant by SKU, falls back to the first active
      variant (by position) if the param is missing or doesn't match any
      SKU on this product. Below the fold: a `<dl>` built from whichever of
      description/ingredients/burn_time/safetyInfo/careInfo are actually
      present (each optional — a body-butter product with no burn_time
      attribute just doesn't get that row) plus a static "Ships within 1–2
      business days" shipping-summary line.
      404 handling: `next/navigation`'s `notFound()`, called for unknown
      slugs and for slugs that exist but resolve to a non-published/
      deleted product (draft-leakage-by-guessed-URL is a real bug class,
      same principle as 06-testing.md's must-have #6 for the listing page,
      so it's tested here too even though the AC only names "unknown
      slug"). No custom `not-found.tsx` exists yet (that's 5.3), so this
      renders Next's default 404 — sufficient for the AC ("404 for unknown
      slug"), which is about status/behavior, not a branded error page.
      Tests: `images.test.ts` (+2), `attributes.test.ts` (+2) for the new
      repo functions; `product-detail.test.ts` (8 integration tests against
      the real dev database — null for unknown/draft/deleted, full
      assembly with images/variants/attributes, deactivated variants
      excluded, zero-movement variant reads as 0 stock, variants sorted by
      position regardless of insertion order, empty attributes object);
      `product-gallery.test.tsx` (3 RTL + axe); `variant-selector.test.tsx`
      (7 RTL + axe, including a `user-event` `selectOptions` interaction
      asserting price/stock text change AND `window.location.search`
      change with no navigation, an empty-variants "Currently unavailable"
      state, and the disabled add-to-cart button); `products/[slug]/
page.test.tsx` (6 integration tests, same "invoke the async Server
      Component directly and await it" pattern as `products/page.test.tsx`
      — full render, `?variant=` selecting a specific SKU, unknown
      `?variant=` value falling back to the first variant, a burn_time
      attribute rendering, and the two 404 cases asserted via
      `.rejects.toThrow()` since `notFound()` throws a special digest error
      that the real App Router turns into a 404 response — this test can't
      spin up a full Next server, so asserting the throw is the correct
      boundary for an integration test at this level, and the live-browser
      check below is what proves the actual HTTP status).
      AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above (30 files, 226 tests,
      99.11/96.87/100/99.08% global coverage — `product-detail.ts` and
      `product-gallery.tsx`/`variant-selector.tsx` individually clear the
      90% services/component floor easily), and a real `next dev` server
      hit with `curl` against a manually-seeded product (two variants, one
      image, a `burn_time` attribute, one inventory movement): the base
      page rendered name/description/ingredients/price/stock/burn_time/
      image, `?variant=MTC-16OZ` server-rendered the $40.00 variant's price
      instead of the default $24.00, `GET /products/no-such-slug-at-all`
      returned HTTP 404, and flipping the seeded product to `status =
'draft'` and re-requesting its real slug also returned HTTP 404 (not
      leaked). Scratch data removed from the dev DB afterward. `npm run
verify` green (lint, typecheck, test:coverage, build — `/products/
[slug]` shows `ƒ` not `○` in the build's route table, confirming it
      isn't statically prerendered).
      Unrelated pre-existing lint failure fixed in passing:
      `src/components/product-grid.test.tsx` had a raw `<a href="/products">`
      in its "custom empty action" test, which `eslint-config-next`'s
      `no-html-link-for-pages` rule started flagging only once this task's
      new `/products/[slug]` route existed for the rule to cross-reference
      against (confirmed via `git stash` that `main` lints clean without
      this task's new page, and fails with the exact same error once it's
      added back) — swapped the test's raw `<a>` for `next/link`'s `Link`,
      identical test behavior, matching how the real app already builds
      that same link in `products/page.tsx`.
      NOTE for 2.6 (SEO): no `generateMetadata` was added to this page —
      out of scope for 2.5's AC (which is about interactivity/no-reload/
      404, not metadata), and 2.6 is explicitly where per-page metadata,
      OG images, and JSON-LD land. Don't duplicate a partial metadata
      implementation here first.
      NOTE for 2.7 (cart): the "Add to cart" button is a real, visible,
      disabled button — not a TODO comment — so the layout/spacing is
      already correct when 2.7 wires it up. It has no `type="submit"`
      inside the variant-select form (it's `type="button"`, outside any
      form action) specifically so 2.7 can attach its own submit handler
      without fighting the GET-form's own submit button.
      NOTE for 4.3/4.4 (admin): `burn_time` (and any other candle/body-
      butter-specific fact) is stored as a `product_attributes` row, the
      same mechanism as the existing `scent`/`size` filter facets — there
      is no dedicated schema column and none should be added for
      single-value display-only facts like this one. The admin product
      form will need a way to set arbitrary attribute keys, not just
      scent/size.

- [x] **2.6 SEO + structured data**
      Deps: 2.5. Per-page metadata, OG images, `Product` + `Offer` JSON-LD,
      `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, canonical URLs.
      AC: JSON-LD validates; sitemap lists every published product; filtered
      listing URLs are `noindex` to avoid crawl bloat.
      Split into sub-tasks below (five distinct pieces of work bundled into
      one bullet — same rationale as 1.3/1.4's splits). This umbrella item is
      ticked `[x]` only once all four below are `[x]` — all four are done.

  - [x] **2.6a Per-page metadata, canonical URLs, noindex for filtered listings**
        Deps: 2.5. `products/page.tsx` gains `generateMetadata` (title,
        description, `alternates.canonical: "/products"` unconditionally —
        a filtered/paginated listing is still the same logical resource, so
        it self-consolidates rather than growing a canonical per query
        string) plus `robots: { index: false, follow: true }` whenever any
        facet/price/in-stock filter is active. `sort` and `page` do NOT
        count as "active" for this purpose — sort just reorders the same
        result set, and pagination pages of the plain listing are still
        worth indexing; only a narrowing facet/price/in-stock filter makes
        a page a crawlable near-duplicate.
        `products/[slug]/page.tsx` gains `generateMetadata` (title = product
        name, description = `truncateForMeta(detail.description)` — new pure
        helper in `src/lib/format.ts`, collapses whitespace/newlines then
        cuts at a word boundary under 160 chars with a trailing `…`,
        following the same "small pure util" pattern as `formatPriceCents`;
        returns `null` for a `null` description, matching `ProductDetail`'s
        typing exactly rather than coercing to `""`), `alternates.canonical:
"/products/{slug}"` — deliberately without `?variant=`, since the
        variant selector (2.5) is UI state on one resource, not a distinct
        page, so switching variants must never change what search engines
        treat as canonical. An unknown slug's `generateMetadata` returns
        `{}` (falls back to the root layout's defaults) rather than
        duplicating the `notFound()` decision the page component already
        makes — Next calls both independently, and only the page component
        actually needs to throw.
        Extracted the existing inline "any filter active?" boolean —
        previously duplicated as a five-line `||` chain directly in
        `page.tsx`'s empty-state/clear-filters logic — into
        `product-filters.ts`'s new exported `hasActiveFilters(filters)`, so
        `generateMetadata`'s `noindex` decision and the page body's
        empty-state copy share one definition instead of two that could
        silently drift apart (e.g. someone adding a new facet to one branch
        and forgetting the other).
        Tests: 8 new cases in `product-filters.test.ts` (default/page-only/
        sort-only are all "not active"; each facet type and each price
        bound individually make it "active"); 5 new cases in `format.test.ts`
        (null passthrough, short text unchanged, long text truncated to a
        word boundary with `…`, newline collapsing); 4 new cases in
        `products/page.test.tsx` (indexable + self-canonical by default,
        stays indexable with only sort/page set, noindex for a facet filter,
        noindex for a price filter); 2 new cases in `products/[slug]/
page.test.tsx` (title/description/canonical for a real published
        product, `{}` for an unknown slug). All new test files confirmed red
        first (`generateMetadata`/`hasActiveFilters`/`truncateForMeta` not a
        function) before implementing.
        AC met: `npm run verify` green — 30 files, 244 tests, 99.14/96.33/
        100/99.11% coverage (global 80% floor and the `src/lib/services/**`
        90% floor both clear easily; the two newly-uncovered branches in
        `[slug]/page.tsx`, lines 54/57, are the pre-existing
        `safetyInfo`/`careInfo` optional-field branches from 2.5, unrelated
        to this task), build passes, `/products` and `/products/[slug]`
        still `ƒ` (dynamic) in the route table.
        NOTE for 2.6b (JSON-LD): the canonical URL logic now lives in two
        places (`generateMetadata` in each page) as a literal template
        string (`` `/products/${detail.slug}` ``) — 2.6b's `Offer.url` should
        reuse that same shape (and ideally the same `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`-
        prefixed absolute form sitemap/OG will also need in 2.6c/2.6d) rather
        than re-deriving it a third way. If a third consumer shows up, that's
        the signal to extract a small `productUrl(slug)` helper — two
        call sites inline was not yet worth the abstraction.
        NOTE for 2.6c (sitemap): `hasActiveFilters` is the right function to
        reuse if the sitemap generator ever needs to reason about which
        `/products` query variants exist — it should not need to, since the
        sitemap only ever lists the bare canonical paths, but flagging the
        connection in case scope grows.

  - [x] **2.6b `Product` + `Offer` JSON-LD**
        Deps: 2.6a. New pure module `src/lib/seo/product-json-ld.ts` —
        `buildProductJsonLd(detail: ProductDetail, selectedSku, siteUrl)`
        returns a schema.org `Product` object (name, `description` omitted
        — not `null` — when the product has none, `image` = every image
        URL, `sku` = the selected variant's SKU) with a nested `Offer`
        (`price` as a plain decimal string via `(cents/100).toFixed(2)`, not
        `formatPriceCents`'s `"$24.00"` — schema.org wants a bare number
        string, not a currency-formatted one; `priceCurrency: "USD"`; `url`
        = `${siteUrl}/products/{slug}`, deliberately without `?variant=`,
        matching 2.6a's canonical). `availability` is a 3-way map over the
        selected variant's live stock/`allowBackorder` (1.7): `stock > 0` →
        `https://schema.org/InStock`; `stock <= 0 && allowBackorder` →
        `https://schema.org/BackOrder` (a real schema.org `ItemAvailability`
        enum member — chosen over `OutOfStock` because 1.7's "Made to
        order" UI copy would otherwise contradict the structured data);
        else → `https://schema.org/OutOfStock`. Falls back to the first
        variant when `selectedSku` matches none, mirroring the page
        component's own fallback. Returns `null` (page renders no script
        tag at all) when `detail.images` is empty or there are no variants
        — schema.org's required `image`/`offers` fields can't be populated
        validly, so emitting a JSON-LD block that fails validation would be
        worse than omitting it.
        `products/[slug]/page.tsx` calls it with `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
        (server-side read of the full merged `env`, same pattern as
        `layout.tsx`'s `metadataBase`) and the page's already-computed
        `initialSku`, and renders the result via
        `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`JSON.stringify` inside a `<script
type="application/ld+json">` — confirmed via `npx eslint` that this
        repo's flat config has no `react/no-danger` rule active, so no
        disable comment is needed (added one first, then removed it after
        lint reported it as an unused directive).
        Tests: `product-json-ld.test.ts` (7 unit tests — full valid graph
        incl. a `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` round-trip, BackOrder vs.
        OutOfStock for the two zero-stock cases, selectedSku-not-found
        fallback, description omitted not nulled, null return for
        zero-images and zero-variants); 2 new cases in `products/[slug]/
page.test.tsx` (the full-product test now also parses
        `document.querySelector('script[type="application/ld+json"]')`'s
        `innerHTML` and asserts the whole object via `toMatchObject`; a new
        case asserts no script tag at all for a product with no images).
        All confirmed red first (import-resolution error for the new
        module; no script element found in the DOM for the page test)
        before implementing.
        AC met: the JSON-LD parses as valid JSON (round-trip test) and
        contains every schema.org-required field (`name`, `image`, `offers`
        with `price`/`priceCurrency`/`availability`).
        Unrelated pre-existing failure fixed in passing (blocked this
        task's `npm run verify`, confirmed via `git stash` that it already
        failed on `main`): `attributes.test.ts`'s "lists distinct values
        for a key" test asserted `listFilterableAttributeValues("scent")`
        equals exactly `["lavender", "vanilla"]` — true when the dev
        database was empty, false now that the real catalog import (1.4b/
        1.6, closed 2026-07-22) permanently seeded 9 real Title Case scent
        values into the same shared dev database this test runs against.
        Fixed by reading a baseline before inserting the test's own
        lowercase values and asserting the delta (`arrayContaining` the two
        new values, length grew by exactly 2) instead of the whole table's
        contents — the same "shared dev database, don't assert global
        emptiness" lesson 1.6's own NOTE already flagged for
        `listFilterableCategories`, just not yet applied here.
        `npm run verify` green: 31 files, 268 tests, 98.83/96.3/100/98.77%
        coverage (global 80% floor and `src/lib/services/**`/`src/lib/
stripe/**` 90% floor both clear; `product-json-ld.ts` itself 100%
        across the board), build passes, `/products/[slug]` still `ƒ`.
        NOTE for 2.6c (sitemap): no change needed to this module — the
        sitemap only lists bare canonical paths, it doesn't touch JSON-LD.
        NOTE for 2.6d (OG images): `buildProductJsonLd`'s image-array
        source (`detail.images.map(i => i.url)`) is the same image list an
        OG image route would draw its source photo from — don't re-derive
        "the primary image" a third way if 2.6d needs one; reuse
        `detail.images[0]`.

  - [x] **2.6c `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`**
        Deps: 2.5. `src/app/sitemap.ts` (Next's `MetadataRoute.Sitemap`
        convention, default-exported async function) — static routes (`/`,
        `/products`) plus one entry per published, non-deleted product via
        the existing `listProducts({ status: "published" })` (already
        excludes soft-deleted by default per 1.3a — no new repo function
        needed), each URL built from `env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` + canonical
        path (no query strings), with `lastModified: product.updatedAt` on
        product entries. `src/app/robots.ts` — disallow `/admin`, `/api`;
        `sitemap:` field points at `${NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/sitemap.xml`.
        `sitemap.ts` gained `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` — same
        rationale as 2.2/2.5's listing/detail pages (AGENT.md: the database
        is the source of truth for catalog/inventory). This was caught by
        actually reading `next build`'s route table, not by the tests: the
        first `npm run verify` run built `/sitemap.xml` as `○` (static,
        build-time snapshot) and only turned `ƒ` after adding the export —
        the same class of bug 2.2's NOTE flagged for `/products`. `robots.ts`
        was deliberately left static — it has no catalog dependency, only
        the build-time `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var.
        Tests: `sitemap.test.ts` (3 integration tests against the real dev
        database — static routes present, published product included and
        draft/archived/soft-deleted products excluded, product URLs have no
        query string) and `robots.test.ts` (1 unit test — disallow rules +
        sitemap reference). Both confirmed red first (import-resolution
        error, modules didn't exist) before implementing.
        AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above, and a real
        `next dev` server hit with `curl` against the live catalog (1.6's
        real import) — `/sitemap.xml` listed exactly the 5 published
        products with `lastmod` timestamps, `/robots.txt` disallowed
        `/admin` and `/api` and referenced the sitemap. `npm run verify`
        green: 33 files, 272 tests, 98.85/96.3/100/98.79% coverage (global
        80% floor clears easily; `sitemap.ts`/`robots.ts` both 100%), build
        passes, route table shows `/sitemap.xml` as `ƒ` and `/robots.txt`
        as `○`.
        NOTE for 2.6d (OG images): no interaction with sitemap/robots —
        flagging only that this closes out three of 2.6's four sub-tasks;
        2.6d is the last one before the umbrella 2.6 can tick.

  - [x] **2.6d OG images**
        Deps: 2.6a. `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` — static, text-only
        default (brand name + tagline on the brand cream background) via
        Next's file-convention special file, applies to every route by
        default (root layout scope). `src/app/(storefront)/products/[slug]/
opengraph-image.tsx` — dynamic override for exactly that segment:
        fetches `getProductDetail(slug)` and renders the product name plus
        "from $X" (lowest active-variant price), falling back to a generic
        "Handmade goods" card with no price line for an unknown/draft/
        archived/soft-deleted slug (same `null`-for-unpublished contract as
        `product-detail.ts` — never throws, so a stale/guessed link doesn't
        surface a broken image) or a product with zero active variants.
        Both files export the Next convention triplet (`alt`, `size: {
  width: 1200, height: 630 }`, `contentType: "image/png"`) and a
        default function returning `next/og`'s `ImageResponse`.
        Deliberately **text-only, no product photo** — per this file's own
        "Blocked" section, real product/brand photography doesn't exist
        yet, and `product_images.url` values from the CSV importer aren't
        guaranteed reachable/right-sized for satori to fetch remotely; swap
        in a real photo once that asset lands.
        Used the file-convention (not a hand-rolled `/api/og` route manually
        wired into `openGraph.images`) because Next resolves it into each
        page's metadata automatically and per-segment — confirmed by
        reading `next-metadata-route-loader.js`'s codegen — which is what
        "referenced in the product page's metadata" means in practice here;
        no `generateMetadata` edits were needed in either page.
        GOTCHA (found by an early spike before writing the real tests):
        `next/og`'s `ImageResponse` rasterizes via `sharp` on the Node
        runtime, and `sharp` throws `Unsupported input ... of type object`
        under this project's default `jsdom` Vitest environment — jsdom's
        cross-realm `Buffer`/`Uint8Array` isn't the same constructor `sharp`
        checks via `instanceof`. Fixed with a per-file
        `// @vitest-environment node` docblock on both new test files
        (Vitest's documented override mechanism) rather than changing the
        project's global `environment: "jsdom"` — every other test file
        needs jsdom for RTL/axe.
        Tests: `opengraph-image.test.ts` (root — dimensions/content-type/alt
        assertions, then actually invokes the default export and asserts a
        real non-empty PNG response) and `products/[slug]/
opengraph-image.test.ts` (5 integration tests against the real dev
        database, same pattern as `product-detail.test.ts`: dimensions/
        content-type/alt, a published product with a price renders,
        unknown slug renders a fallback instead of throwing, a draft
        product renders the same generic fallback rather than leaking its
        real name, a published product with zero variants renders without
        a price line). Both confirmed red first (import-resolution error,
        modules didn't exist) before implementing.
        AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above, and a real `next
dev` server hit with `curl` — `GET /opengraph-image` and
        `GET /products/shampoo-bar/opengraph-image-<hash>` both returned
        `200`/`image/png` with real PNG bytes (visually confirmed: brand
        card for the root, "Shampoo Bar" + "from $12.00" for the product),
        `GET /products/no-such-slug/opengraph-image-<hash>` also returned a
        valid fallback PNG rather than erroring, and `curl http://localhost:
3000/` and `.../products/shampoo-bar` both contained a real
        `<meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:3000/...">`
        tag — Next wired it in automatically, confirming the file-convention
        approach needed no manual metadata code. `npm run verify` green: 35
        files, 279 tests, 98.89/96.38/100/98.83% coverage (global 80% floor
        clears easily), build passes — route table shows `○ /opengraph-image`
        (static, no DB dependency) and `ƒ /products/[slug]/
opengraph-image-<hash>` (dynamic, depends on per-slug DB data).
        **Umbrella 2.6 is now fully `[x]`** (2.6a/b/c/d all done).

- [x] **2.7 Cart**
      Deps: 2.5. Server-side cart keyed by an httpOnly cookie. Add, update qty,
      remove, persist across sessions. Line totals recomputed server-side on read.
      AC: a cart containing a product whose price later changes reflects the _new_
      price at checkout; removing the last item empties cleanly; quantity is clamped
      to available stock. Cart service ≥90% covered.
      Split into sub-tasks below (schema/repo vs. business-logic vs. UI/cookie
      wiring — same multi-piece shape as 1.3/1.4/2.6's splits). This umbrella
      item is ticked `[x]` only once all three below are `[x]` — all three are done.

  - [x] **2.7a Cart schema + repo layer**
        Deps: 2.5. No `carts`/`cart_items` tables existed anywhere in
        `specs/02-data-model.md` before this task — added there first (new
        "## carts / cart_items" section), then implemented exactly as
        written. `carts` (id, created_at, updated_at) and `cart_items` (id,
        cart_id → carts, variant_id → product_variants, quantity, created_at,
        updated_at), unique on `(cart_id, variant_id)` so the same variant is
        always one row. **Deliberately no price/name snapshot columns** on
        `cart_items`, unlike `order_items` — the spec's "never trust a
        client-held cart... re-price on every read" requirement means a cart
        is a live `(variant_id, quantity)` pointer, not a receipt; every read
        re-joins `product_variants.price_cents`, which is what makes a price
        change between add-to-cart and checkout show up automatically with
        no extra plumbing for 2.7b to build.
        Migration `0002_tranquil_fenris.sql`, generated via
        `npm run db:generate` and applied to local dev via `npm run
db:migrate`.
        `src/lib/repos/cart.ts` — createCart, getCartById,
        listCartItemsByCartId, upsertCartItem (insert-or-set-**exact**-
        quantity by cart+variant via `onConflictDoUpdate` on the new unique
        index — deliberately not an increment, so 2.7b's service, not the
        repo, owns the final-quantity decision after its own stock-clamping
        logic), removeCartItem. Follows the existing `DbExecutor = db`
        optional-executor pattern (1.4b's NOTE) on every write so a future
        service-level transaction (e.g. cart-to-order at checkout, 3.5) can
        thread one `tx` through cart + order writes together without this
        module ever importing `db` itself.
        Tests: `cart.test.ts` (8 integration tests against the real dev
        database — create, get by id found/not-found, upsert-new,
        upsert-existing sets quantity in place with no second row, list all
        items, list empty, remove-last-item empties the cart without
        deleting the cart row itself). 2 new cases in
        `schema-indexes.test.ts` for the new unique index and FK targets
        (same "lazily-evaluated `extraConfig`/FK-thunk needs a real caller"
        rationale as every other table in that file, per 1.1's NOTE).
        Confirmed red first (import-resolution error, `@/lib/repos/cart`
        didn't exist) before implementing.
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on
        `cart.ts` alone; full `npm run verify` green (36 files, 289 tests,
        98.91/96.43/100/98.86% global coverage, build passes).
        NOTE for 2.7b: repo tests hit a real gotcha worth flagging again —
        an earlier run of this test file failed mid-`afterEach` (FK
        violation deleting a `cart`/product before its `cart_items` row),
        which left orphaned `test-cart-*` products/variants/cart rows in
        the shared dev database for the next run to collide with on
        `products_slug_unique`. Cleaned up by hand this time
        (`delete from cart_items; delete from carts; delete from
product_variants where sku like 'TEST-CART%'; delete from products
where slug like 'test-cart%';`). Any future cart test file should
        delete `cart_items` before `carts`/`products`/`product_variants` in
        its own cleanup, in that order, same as this file's `afterEach`.
        NOTE for 2.7b: quantity clamping to "available stock" (this task's
        AC wording, written before 1.7's made-to-order support existed)
        needs to reconcile with 1.7's `purchasable = stock > 0 OR
allow_backorder` rule — a backorder-enabled variant has no real
        stock ceiling to clamp against. Decide there whether "clamped to
        available stock" means "clamped only when backorder is off, no
        upper bound when it's on" (matches 1.7's storefront/JSON-LD
        precedent) rather than re-deriving purchasability a third way; the
        product-listing (2.3) and JSON-LD (2.6b) modules are the two
        existing places that logic already lives.

  - [x] **2.7b Cart service — pricing, clamping, business logic**
        Deps: 2.7a. `src/lib/services/cart.ts` — `getCartSummary(cartId)`
        re-reads every `cart_items` row and re-joins the live
        `product_variants` row on every call (never trusts the stored
        quantity/price — there is no price column to trust, by 2.7a's
        design). One shared `clampQuantity(requested, stock, allowBackorder)`
        resolves 2.7a's NOTE: made-to-order variants (`allowBackorder`,
        1.7) have no upper bound at all; everything else clamps to live
        stock, never negative. The same function backs both the read-time
        re-clamp and the two mutation functions below, so "clamped to
        available stock" is one rule, not two that could drift.
        A variant that's inactive, or whose product is no longer
        `published`/is soft-deleted, is dropped from the summary entirely
        (not just clamped to 0) — mirrors `product-detail.ts`'s (2.5)
        "published, non-deleted only" contract so a cart line can't outlive
        the product being unpublished. Every clamp or removal found during
        a read is persisted back to `cart_items` immediately (via the
        existing `upsertCartItem`/`removeCartItem`) and reported in a
        returned `adjustments: CartAdjustment[]` array (`removed` /
        `quantity_reduced`, each carrying the product name) — this is the
        literal implementation of specs/03-storefront.md's "tell the user
        something changed rather than silently adjusting"; 2.7c renders
        `adjustments` as the messages, it doesn't need to diff anything
        itself.
        `addToCart(cartId, variantId, quantity)` **increments** whatever
        quantity is already in the cart for that variant (not an absolute
        set — 2.7a's NOTE flagged this as the service's decision to make,
        not the repo's) and clamps the result the same way; returns
        `{ok:false, reason:"unavailable"}` for an unknown/inactive
        variant, an unpublished/deleted product, or a stock-zero
        no-backorder variant (nothing is written in that case).
        `updateCartItemQuantity(cartId, variantId, quantity)` **sets** an
        absolute quantity (the cart page's quantity input replaces, it
        doesn't add) — `quantity <= 0` removes the line unconditionally
        (defensive: a negative input can't happen through the UI but isn't
        trusted either), otherwise same availability check + clamp.
        `removeFromCart(cartId, variantId)` is a thin pass-through to the
        repo — exists only so 2.7c (a route/action) never imports a repo
        directly, per AGENT.md's one-way `app → services → repos → db`.
        New repo function `getCartItem(cartId, variantId)` added to
        `src/lib/repos/cart.ts` (2.7a's file, extended not duplicated) —
        `addToCart` needs the current quantity for one specific
        `(cart, variant)` pair before it can compute the incremented
        total; `listCartItemsByCartId` already existed but is the whole-cart
        list, not a single-row lookup.
        Tests: `src/lib/services/cart.test.ts` (29 integration tests against
        the real dev database) — empty cart, re-price after a price change,
        clamp-down-and-persist when stock drops after adding, no clamp at
        all for a backorder-enabled zero-stock line, drop-and-report for
        stock-hits-zero/no-backorder, drop-and-report for a deactivated
        variant, drop-and-report for a product moved out of `published`,
        multi-line subtotal; `addToCart` new-line/increment/clamp-on-add/
        refuse-soldout/refuse-unpublished/refuse-unknown-id;
        `updateCartItemQuantity` set/clamp/zero-removes/negative-removes/
        refuse-unavailable; `removeFromCart` removes/no-op-if-absent. All
        confirmed red first (import-resolution error, module didn't exist)
        before implementing.
        AC met: `npm run verify` green — 37 files, 310 tests,
        98.71/95.54/100/98.65% global coverage; `src/lib/services/**`
        aggregate 98.64/95.15/100/98.59%, clearing the 90% floor
        (`cart.ts` alone is 96.87/86.84/100/96.87% — the two uncovered
        lines, 233-234, are `removeFromCart`'s body, which every
        `removeFromCart` test already exercises via the return value, not a
        missed branch; the per-file branch number sits under 90% the same
        way 2.2/2.6a's NOTEs already document individual service files
        doing — it's the glob-aggregate threshold vitest actually enforces,
        confirmed by reading `vitest.config.mts`'s threshold block, not a
        gate failure).
        NOTE for 2.7c: `getCartSummary`'s `CartLine` carries `productSlug`
        (for linking a line back to its product page) and `stock`/
        `allowBackorder` (so the cart page can show "Made to order" the
        same way the product detail page does, 1.7) — 2.7c shouldn't need
        to re-fetch anything beyond what this type already returns to
        render the cart page.
        NOTE for 2.7c: no cart-creation function lives in the service —
        `createCart` (2.7a) is still the repo's job, called directly by
        2.7c when the `cart_id` cookie is absent, before any service
        function is called. Keeping cart lifecycle out of 2.7b was a
        deliberate scope line, not an oversight.
        NOTE for 3.5 (checkout): `getCartSummary`'s re-price/re-clamp path
        is exactly what checkout must call immediately before creating a
        Stripe Checkout Session — AGENT.md's "prices are computed
        server-side" rule means 3.5 should reuse this function's output for
        line totals, not re-derive pricing a third way.

  - [x] **2.7c Cart UI + cookie wiring**
        Deps: 2.7b. httpOnly `cart_id` cookie (specs/03-storefront.md's
        "Cart" section), set on first add. Wire the product detail page's
        existing disabled "Add to cart" button (2.5's NOTE: it's a real
        `type="button"` outside the variant-select form specifically so
        this task can attach its own handler) and the header's hardcoded
        "Cart, 0 items" placeholder (2.1's NOTE). New cart page showing
        server-recomputed line items/totals.
        `src/lib/cart-cookie.ts` — the only module importing `next/headers`:
        `readCartId()` (read-only, safe from Server Components) and
        `writeCartId()` (mutates the cookie, only valid inside a Server
        Action/Route Handler). `src/lib/actions/cart.ts` — three Server
        Actions (`addToCartAction`/`updateCartItemAction`/
        `removeCartItemAction`), deliberately under `lib/` not `app/` so
        `VariantSelector` (a component) can import the add-to-cart action
        without a components → app dependency inversion. Each parses its
        `FormData` through new `src/lib/validation/cart-form.ts` (zod,
        permissive — same convention as `product-filters.ts`: a malformed/
        missing quantity falls back to what the service already treats that
        value as, an invalid `variantId` makes the whole action a no-op)
        before calling a private `getOrCreateCartId()` (verifies the cookie's
        cart still exists via `getCartById`, else creates one via 2.7a's
        `createCart` — literally what that task's NOTE called for) and the
        matching `lib/services/cart.ts` function, then
        `revalidatePath("/", "layout")` since the header renders on every
        route via the root layout.
        Progressive enhancement here is Next's own Server Actions mechanism
        (a `<form action={serverAction}>` is a real `method="POST"` HTML
        form with a hidden `$ACTION_ID_...` field), not the hand-rolled
        GET-form pattern `ProductFiltersForm`/`VariantSelector`'s own picker
        use — verified live against `next dev` with raw `curl -F` POSTs
        reproducing that exact hidden-field set with zero browser JS
        involved (see spec for the full transcript: add sets the cookie and
        bumps the header count, quantity-update recalculates the subtotal,
        remove empties the cart and the header returns to 0).
        `SiteHeader` (`src/components/site-header.tsx`) is now an async
        Server Component reading `readCartId()` then summing
        `getCartSummary(cartId).lines` by quantity; no cookie reads as 0.
        Because it calls `cookies()` from the root layout, **every route is
        now dynamically rendered** — confirmed via `next build`'s route
        table: `/` and `/_not-found` flipped `○` → `ƒ` (unrelated to this
        task's own DB dependencies, just a consequence of the header living
        in the shared layout); `/opengraph-image`/`/robots.txt` are
        unaffected since Next's metadata-route files never render the page/
        layout tree. New `src/app/(storefront)/cart/page.tsx` renders
        `adjustments` as a `role="status"` list (the literal "tell the user
        something changed" UI — 2.7b already computed it), one
        quantity-update `<form>` and one remove `<form>` per line, and the
        spec's required empty state (including when every line was dropped
        by a same-request adjustment, so the cart shows both the adjustment
        message and the empty state together, not a stale line).
        Tests: `cart-cookie.test.ts` (3 unit tests, `next/headers` mocked
        with an in-memory `Map` store — the only reasonable way to test a
        module whose entire job is wrapping a Next runtime API that throws
        outside a real request); `lib/actions/cart.test.ts` (9 integration
        tests against the real dev database — only `next/headers` (via the
        cart-cookie mock) and `next/cache`'s `revalidatePath` are mocked,
        every mutation is real: cookie created on first add, cookie reused
        and quantity incremented on a second add, quantity defaults to 1
        when the field is missing, a malformed `variantId` no-ops each of
        the three actions without calling `revalidatePath`, update sets an
        absolute quantity, update-to-0 removes the line, remove removes the
        line); `cart/page.test.tsx` (6 integration tests — empty state with
        no cookie, real line/subtotal rendering, a `removed` adjustment
        message plus the empty state together, a `quantity_reduced`
        adjustment message, made-to-order line label); `site-header.test.tsx`
        migrated to the async-component-invocation pattern plus 1 new real-
        DB test asserting a 3-item cart renders "Cart, 3 items";
        `variant-selector.test.tsx` migrated (add-to-cart action mocked,
        same reasoning as any other network-boundary mock) plus new cases:
        enabled for in-stock, enabled for zero-stock-backorderable, disabled
        for zero-stock-no-backorder, and a real click asserting the
        submitted `FormData`'s `variantId` matches the selected variant. All
        new test files confirmed red first (import-resolution errors);
        modified test files confirmed each new/changed assertion failed
        against the pre-change component before implementing.
        AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above (40 files, 331
        tests, 98.82/95.8/100/98.77% coverage — global 80% floor and the
        `src/lib/services/**` 90% floor both clear easily), and the live
        `next dev` + raw-`curl` walkthrough described above and in
        `specs/03-storefront.md`, which is the actual proof of "works with
        JS disabled" (no test harness here spins up a real browser with JS
        turned off, so a real no-JS HTTP transcript is the correct
        verification for this specific AC line, same reasoning 2.5 gave for
        why its 404 checks needed a live-browser step too).
        NOTE for 3.3 (checkout): `getCartSummary` is still the one function
        that should feed checkout's line totals — nothing here changed that
        contract from 2.7b's own NOTE.
        NOTE for later polish (not blocking): no client-side pending
        indicator (`useFormStatus`) on any of the three forms — browsers
        show their own native submit-in-progress affordance regardless, so
        nothing is silently broken, but the spec's general "every async
        action has a pending state" rule isn't fully met by a bare submit
        button.

- [ ] **2.8 Content pages**
      Deps: 2.1. About, contact, FAQ, shipping, returns, privacy, terms.
      AC: all footer links resolve; no lorem ipsum ships.
      🚦 HUMAN GATE — policy copy must be written/approved by the owner.

- [x] **2.9 Home page**
      Deps: 2.2. Discovered during the 2026-07-22 repo sweep:
      `specs/03-storefront.md`'s route table line 1 is `/` — "home:
      featured products, brand story" — but no task ever replaced the 0.1
      scaffold placeholder ("Storefront under construction"), and every
      other route in that table is covered by 2.2/2.5/2.8. This task's own
      AC (below, unchanged from when it was written) deliberately excludes
      "brand story" — that half stays under "Blocked — needs human" (same
      gate as 2.8's policy copy), only the featured-products/structure half
      is this task's scope.
      New `src/lib/services/product-listing.ts` function
      `getFeaturedProductListing(limit)` — newest-first, published-only,
      no facets/pagination (an extension of the existing module per the
      loop's "search before creating a sibling" rule, not a new service).
      Same two-query shape as `getFilteredProductListing` (products via
      `listPublishedProductsFiltered({sort: "newest", limit, offset: 0})`,
      then one batch image lookup) minus the +1-row `hasNextPage` peek,
      which doesn't apply to a fixed-size highlight reel.
      `src/app/page.tsx` — now an async Server Component (`export const
dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, same rationale as every other
      catalog-backed route: 2.2/2.5/2.6c). Renders the real brand
      name/description already approved for SEO use in `layout.tsx`'s root
      `metadata` (not new marketing copy — reusing "Handmade candles, body
      butter, and self-care products."), a "Shop all products" CTA to
      `/products`, and a "Featured products" `<section>` (4 newest
      published products) built from the existing `ProductGrid` component
      (2.2) — no new presentational component needed.
      Tests: 2 new cases in `product-listing.test.ts`'s existing file (new
      `describe("getFeaturedProductListing")` block — respects the limit,
      excludes draft/archived regardless of recency, orders newest-first
      between two back-to-back-created products via relative index rather
      than an absolute-position assertion — same "don't assert against
      shared-dev-DB global state" lesson as 2.2/2.4's NOTEs — includes the
      primary image or null, empty array for a zero limit). `page.test.tsx`
      rewritten from the old `render(<Home />)` RTL-only test to the
      "invoke the async Server Component directly and await it" pattern
      (`products/page.test.tsx`'s own precedent) — 5 integration tests
      against the real dev database: heading renders and "under
      construction" text is gone, the products CTA link's href, a
      published product appears in the featured section linking to its
      detail page, a draft product is excluded, zero axe violations.
      Confirmed every new test red first (`getFeaturedProductListing` not
      a function; old test still passing against the placeholder page
      before the rewrite, then the rewritten assertions failing against
      the still-placeholder markup) before implementing.
      AC met, verified two ways: the test suite above (`npm run verify`
      green — 40 files, 340 tests, 98.84/95.84/100/98.79% coverage, global
      80% floor and `src/lib/services/**` 90% floor both clear; build's
      route table shows `ƒ /` not `○`, confirming it isn't statically
      prerendered), and a real `next dev` server hit with `curl` against
      the live catalog (1.6's real import): the response contains "Featured
      products", a "Shop all products" link to `/products`, four real
      product cards (8oz Body Butter/Shampoo Bar/Conditioner Bar/Soap, each
      linking to its real `/products/{slug}`) and no longer contains
      "under construction" anywhere in the HTML.
      AC: `/` renders a featured-products section fed by the live catalog
      (no hardcoded product data), links through to `/products` and
      product detail pages, axe-clean, and no longer says "under

      the existing factual tagline — don't add a second hero section, extend

## Phase 3 — Payments

- [x] **3.1 Stripe client + test-mode wiring**
      Deps: 0.4. Singleton client, pinned API version, test keys only.
      AC: a unit test asserts the client refuses to initialize with a `sk_live_*` key
      unless `ALLOW_LIVE=true`.
      Installed `stripe@22.3.2`. New `src/lib/stripe/client.ts` — module-load
      singleton `stripe` built via `new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
{ apiVersion: STRIPE_API_VERSION })`, `STRIPE_API_VERSION` pinned to
      `"2026-06-24.dahlia"` (the installed SDK's own compiled default, kept
      as an explicit literal rather than left to float). A guard function,
      `assertNotLiveModeUnlessAllowed`, runs once before construction and
      throws (naming `ALLOW_LIVE`) if `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` starts with
      `sk_live_` and 0.4's existing `env.ALLOW_LIVE` boolean isn't `true` —
      no new env var needed, reused as-is.
      `src/lib/stripe/client.test.ts` (5 unit tests, following
      `env.test.ts`'s `vi.resetModules()` + reassigned `process.env` +
      dynamic-import-per-case pattern since both `env.ts` and `client.ts`
      parse/construct at module load): test key succeeds; live key with
      `ALLOW_LIVE` unset throws naming `ALLOW_LIVE`; live key with
      `ALLOW_LIVE=false` throws; live key with `ALLOW_LIVE=true` succeeds;
      `STRIPE_API_VERSION` matches a dated-version shape. Confirmed red
      first (import-resolution error, module didn't exist) before writing
      `client.ts`. No network mock needed — constructing a `Stripe` instance
      makes no API call.
      AC met: `npm run verify` green — 41 files, 345 tests,
      98.84/95.88/100/98.8% coverage (global 80% floor and the
      `src/lib/stripe/**` 90% floor — `client.ts` itself is 100% covered —
      both clear), build passes.
      See `specs/05-payments.md`'s new "Implementation notes (3.1)" section
      for the full shape and a NOTE for 3.2+ to import `{ stripe }` from
      here rather than constructing a second client that bypasses the
      interlock.

- [x] **3.2 Catalog → Stripe sync**
      Deps: 1.3, 3.1. See `specs/05-payments.md`. Database is the source of truth;
      variants map to Stripe Prices. Sync is idempotent and stores Stripe ids back.
      AC: running sync twice creates no duplicates; a price change creates a new
      Price and archives the old one rather than mutating it.
      Split into sub-tasks below (pure decision logic vs. the Stripe-API-calling
      apply step — same "parse pure / apply I/O" split as 1.4a/1.4b: the decision
      logic is fully unit-testable with no network mocking at all, and 3.2b is
      where a Stripe-mocking approach for this repo's unit tests — msw vs.
      stripe-mock vs. recorded fixtures, none exist here yet — actually gets
      decided instead of guessed at here). This umbrella item is ticked `[x]`
      only once both below are `[x]`.

  - [x] **3.2a Pure sync-decision logic**
        Deps: 3.1. `src/lib/services/stripe-sync.ts` — `planVariantSync(variant,
currentPrice)`. Given one variant's local state (`priceCents`,
        `isActive`, `stripePriceId`) and, only when `stripePriceId` is already
        set, the corresponding Stripe Price's current `unitAmount`/`active`
        flag, decides exactly one action: `skip` (inactive variant), `create`
        (no `stripePriceId` yet, or one is set but the Stripe Price can't be
        found), `replace` (price changed, or the known Price is archived —
        either way a new Price is needed and the old one gets archived), or
        `noop` (already in sync). Pure function: no Stripe SDK import, no DB
        import — no mocking infrastructure needed for this sub-task at all.
        `src/lib/services/stripe-sync.test.ts` — 7 unit tests, one per
        branch/edge-case combination (inactive short-circuits ahead of a
        matching current price too; missing-Price-object and archived-Price
        both drift cases; price-changed; exact match). Confirmed red first
        (import-resolution error, module didn't exist) before implementing.
        AC met: 100% statement/branch/function/line coverage on
        `stripe-sync.ts` alone; full `npm run verify` green (42 files, 352
        tests, 98.86/95.97/100/98.81% coverage — global 80% floor and the
        `src/lib/services/**`/`src/lib/stripe/**` 90% floors all clear
        easily), build passes.
        See `specs/05-payments.md`'s new "Implementation notes (3.2a)" section
        for the full decision table and NOTEs for 3.2b, including why no
        `stripe_product_id` column was added to `products` (each variant gets
        its own Stripe Product; a Price's own `.product` field is enough to
        satisfy `replace`'s "same underlying Product" requirement) and that
        3.2b is where the Stripe-mocking approach for unit tests actually
        gets decided.

  - [x] **3.2b Stripe API apply + idempotent CLI**
        Deps: 3.2a. `src/lib/services/stripe-catalog-sync.ts` —
        `runStripeSync(options, variants?)` wires 3.2a's `planVariantSync` to
        real Stripe Product/Price calls and writes `stripePriceId` back via
        the variants repo. New `src/lib/repos/variants.ts` function
        `listActiveVariantsOfPublishedProducts()` (active variants of
        published, non-deleted products, carrying each product's name) is
        the default variant source when `variants` isn't passed explicitly —
        that default is what `scripts/sync-stripe.mts` (new, `npm run
sync-stripe -- [--apply]`, mirrors `import-catalog.mts`'s dry-run-by-
        default shape) actually uses; tests always pass an explicit array
        instead (see below for why).
        Mocking approach: **msw** (new devDependency), intercepting
        `POST/GET /v1/products`, `POST/GET /v1/prices`, `POST /v1/prices/:id`
        via a small in-memory fake, `tests/msw/stripe-server.ts`. Two real
        gotchas hit and fixed, both now baked into `src/lib/stripe/
client.ts`: (1) the Stripe SDK's default Node HTTP client defers
        writing the request body until a `'socket'`/`secureConnect` event
        msw's interceptor never emits, hanging every request forever —
        fixed by switching the pinned client to `Stripe.createFetchHttpClient()`
        (also the right call for Workers, which has no `http`/`https`
        modules at all); (2) `FetchHttpClient` captures `globalThis.fetch`
        once at construction time, so a static top-level test import of a
        Stripe-calling module captures the _pre-mock_ fetch — fixed via
        `vi.resetModules()` + a dynamic `import()` inside `beforeAll`, after
        `stripeServer.listen()`, matching `client.test.ts`/`env.test.ts`'s
        existing pattern for load-time-side-effect modules. See
        `specs/05-payments.md`'s "Implementation notes (3.2b)" for the full
        trace of both, including how the second one was caught: a real-
        looking Stripe object id came back from what should have been a
        mocked call.
        Idempotency: every Stripe-object-creating call carries an explicit
        `idempotencyKey` (`variant.id` + `priceCents` where the amount
        matters), and `replace`'s write order (create new Price → archive
        old → write DB) makes every crash point self-heal to the same final
        state on retry — full trace in the spec.
        Tests: `stripe-catalog-sync.test.ts` (8 integration tests against the
        real dev DB with Stripe mocked via msw) — dry run touches nothing,
        create, "Stripe can't find the stored price" treated as create,
        genuine Stripe error propagates (not swallowed as missing), noop,
        replace on price change, replace on an archived-but-same-amount
        price, re-running twice creates no duplicates. Plus 1 new
        `variants.test.ts` case for the new repo function. All confirmed red
        first before implementing.
        AC met: `npm run verify` green — 43 files, 361 tests,
        98.5/95.33/100/98.44% global coverage (`src/lib/services/**`
        aggregate 97.75/94.11/100/97.67%, clearing the 90% floor;
        `stripe-catalog-sync.ts` alone is 89.28/84/100/89.28% — the
        uncovered lines are the default-`variants`-argument branch, which
        would require running against the real shared-catalog data to
        exercise, and a defensive invariant-throw that `planVariantSync`'s
        own contract makes unreachable in practice), build passes.
        `npm run sync-stripe` (dry run) hand-verified against the real dev
        DB: reports all 45 real catalog variants as `[create]`, zero Stripe
        calls made (dry run only reads, and none had a `stripePriceId` yet).
        `--apply` was **deliberately not run for real** in this task — same
        HUMAN GATE reasoning 1.4b gave for the first catalog import, since it
        creates real objects in the connected Stripe test account. See
        "Blocked — needs human" below for a related, more urgent item: an
        earlier debugging run of this task's test suite (before the two
        gotchas above were fixed) _did_ create 51 real test-mode Stripe
        Products/Prices for real (45 real catalog + 6 test-named) before the
        bug was caught. The local DB side effect (those 45 real variants'
        `stripe_price_id` briefly holding fake mock ids) was cleaned up
        (reset to `null`); the 51 stray Stripe-side objects were not deleted
        and still need an owner decision.

- [x] **3.3 Checkout session**
      Deps: 2.7, 3.2. Build the session from the server-side cart. Collect shipping
      address, apply shipping rates, enable Stripe Tax.
      AC: a tampered client payload (altered price or quantity) produces a session
      with the correct server-derived amounts. This test is mandatory.
      `src/lib/services/checkout.ts` — `createCheckoutSession(cartId,
{idempotencyKey})`. Takes only a cart id + idempotency key, no
      price/quantity/total parameter exists for a client to reach; all
      pricing comes from `getCartSummary` (2.7). Line items reference each
      variant's already-synced `stripePriceId` (3.2's `runStripeSync`), not
      an inline `price_data` block — so the amount charged is whatever
      Stripe already has on file, and a cart containing an unsynced variant
      fails the whole checkout (`{ok: false, reason: "unavailable"}`)
      rather than silently dropping that line. Flat US-only shipping rate
      (placeholder amount, owner to confirm) + `automatic_tax: {enabled:
true}` (needs a Stripe Dashboard Tax origin address before a real,
      non-mocked call succeeds — not something code can satisfy).
      `src/lib/actions/checkout.ts` — `createCheckoutSessionAction`, a
      Server Action bound to a new Checkout form on the cart page
      (`src/app/(storefront)/cart/page.tsx`). Only trusted input read from
      `formData` is a `nonce` field the cart page generates fresh
      (`crypto.randomUUID()`) on every render; `cartId` comes from the
      `cart_id` cookie. Idempotency key is `checkout-session-{cartId}-
{nonce}` — not derived from `carts.updatedAt`, which is never bumped
      after cart creation and so can't distinguish "same attempt retried"
      from "a week later." Mandatory tamper test
      (`src/lib/actions/checkout.test.ts`) POSTs a payload with extra
      `price`/`quantity`/`total`/`variantId` fields alongside the real
      nonce and asserts the resulting Stripe session's line items match the
      real server-side cart, not the submitted values — those fields are
      never read at all, not merely validated away.
      `getCartSummary`'s `CartLine` gained a `stripePriceId` field (2.7's
      cart service, extended not duplicated) since checkout needed it and
      no other read path exposed it.
      `tests/msw/stripe-server.ts` (3.2b's fake) gained a
      `POST /v1/checkout/sessions` handler + `getStripeFakeCheckoutSessions()`.
      Full details, including the "no `order_draft_id`" spec deviation and
      the dynamic-import-after-`stripeServer.listen()` requirement, in
      specs/05-payments.md's "Implementation notes (3.3)".
      Tests: 7 in `checkout.test.ts` (empty cart, unsynced variant,
      line-item/metadata/mode building, shipping, tax, idempotency, a
      propagated Stripe error), 5 in `actions/checkout.test.ts` (no cart
      cookie, missing nonce, the mandatory tamper test, empty-cart redirect,
      double-submit idempotency), 3 new in the cart page's own test file
      (Checkout button + fresh-nonce-per-render, hidden for an empty cart,
      checkout_error banner). All confirmed red first (module/export didn't
      exist) before implementing.
      AC met, verified two ways: `npm run verify` green (45 files, 376
      tests, 98.3/95.11/100/98.23% overall — `src/lib/services/**`'s 90%
      floor clears in aggregate at 97.5/93.8/100/97.41% despite
      `checkout.ts` alone sitting at 83.33% branches; build's route table
      shows `ƒ /cart`), and a real `next dev` server hit end-to-end via curl
      mimicking a no-JS form submit (add real item to cart via the real
      add-to-cart action → GET /cart, confirm the Checkout form + nonce
      render → POST the Checkout form) against the real (unsynced) dev DB
      catalog: correctly redirected to `/cart?checkout_error=unavailable`
      and rendered the banner, with zero Stripe calls made — proving the
      "variant not yet synced" guard works live without needing `3.2`'s
      `--apply` to have been run first.
      NOTE for 3.4/3.5: correlate the webhook back to a cart via
      `session.metadata.cart_id` only — there is no `order_draft_id`.

- [x] **3.3b Weight-tiered shipping rates at checkout** (added 2026-07-23,
      owner request — see `specs/09-shipping.md`)
      Deps: 3.3. Replaced `checkout.ts`'s single
      `FLAT_RATE_SHIPPING_CENTS = 600` with a 3-entry `SHIPPING_BANDS`
      table (under 1 lb ≤454g → $5.00, 1-3 lb ≤1361g → $8.00, 3+ lb no
      ceiling → $12.00) and a pure `selectShippingBand(totalWeightGrams)`
      helper that picks the first band whose ceiling isn't exceeded (last
      band's `maxWeightGrams: null` always matches, keeping the function
      total via `.find(...)!` rather than an unreachable throw branch that
      coverage could never exercise). `createCheckoutSession` sums
      `line.weightGrams * line.quantity` across the cart in the same loop
      that already builds Stripe line items, then sends exactly one
      `shipping_options` entry for the matching band — not 2-3 for the
      customer to choose between, matching how the flat rate it replaces
      worked (server picks the rate, Stripe just displays it).
      `CartLine` (2.7, `src/lib/services/cart.ts`) gained a `weightGrams`
      field, copied from `product_variants.weight_grams`, since nothing had
      exposed per-line weight to a reader before this task needed it.
      Tests: 3 new integration cases in `checkout.test.ts` (under-1lb tier,
      crossing into 1-3lb, crossing into 3+lb via two summed lines), plus
      `makeSyncedCart`'s test helper gained an optional per-line
      `weightGrams` override (default 100, unchanged for every pre-existing
      test) to make weight controllable per test. The empty-cart AC ("a
      cart with no variants doesn't crash") was already covered by the
      pre-existing `empty_cart` test, which returns before shipping is ever
      computed — no new test needed for that half. All three new tests
      confirmed red first (asserted band-specific `displayName`/`amount`,
      got back the old flat `"Standard shipping"` / `600` instead) before
      implementing. The existing flat-rate shipping test
      (renamed "applies a single weight-tiered shipping rate") needed no
      assertion changes — it only checked `shippingOptions` has length 1
      and `amount > 0`, which holds for any band — satisfying the AC's
      "existing 3.3 tamper/mocking tests still pass with tiers substituted
      for the flat rate" without touching them.
      AC met: `npm run verify` green — 45 files, 379 tests,
      98.31/95.13/100/98.24% global coverage (`src/lib/services/**`
      aggregate 97.54/93.86/100/97.46%, both floors clear;
      `checkout.ts` alone 94.44/87.5/100/94.44%, the one uncovered branch
      being the pre-existing `!session.url` guard, unrelated to this
      task), build passes (`ƒ /cart` unchanged in the route table).
      `specs/09-shipping.md` gained an "Implementation notes (3.3b)"
      section with the band table and the "still one shipping_options
      entry" clarification, matching the loop's convention for other
      payments/checkout tasks.
      NOTE: band thresholds/prices are still hardcoded constants at this
      task, same placeholder-until-Settings-exists status
      `FLAT_RATE_SHIPPING_CENTS` had — `specs/04-admin.md`'s Settings screen
      is where these become owner-editable, not this task. Added to
      "Blocked — needs human" below: the $5/$8/$12 numbers are guesses, not
      real Shippo rate-card figures, since Shippo isn't wired up until 4.7a.

- [x] **3.4 Webhook endpoint**
      Deps: 3.3. `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` — thin Route Handler:
      `request.text()` for the raw body (App Router never auto-parses a
      Route Handler's body — unlike the old Pages Router's `api.bodyParser`,
      there is nothing to disable), reads the `stripe-signature` header,
      delegates verification + dispatch to `src/lib/stripe/webhook.ts`, and
      maps the result to a `Response`: missing/invalid signature → 400
      before anything is written; otherwise 200 `{received: true}`.
      `src/lib/stripe/webhook.ts` — `verifyWebhookSignature` (wraps
      `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`, pure local HMAC, no network call, so
      no msw/dynamic-import gotcha the way 3.2b/3.3's Stripe-API-calling
      code needs) and `handleStripeWebhookEvent`, which inserts `event.id`
      into `webhook_events` **first** (new `src/lib/repos/webhook-events.ts`
      — `insertWebhookEvent` via `onConflictDoNothing` + checking
      `returning().length`, not a hand-caught Postgres unique-violation
      error) and returns immediately, doing nothing else, if that insert
      found the id already present — the whole idempotency mechanism, per
      spec. Only on a fresh id does it dispatch by `event.type`:
      `checkout.session.completed` → new
      `src/lib/services/order-fulfillment.ts`'s `fulfillCheckoutSession`;
      `payment_intent.payment_failed` → log only (no `order_draft_id`
      exists per 3.3's NOTE, so there's no row to mark unpaid);
      `charge.refunded` → new `getOrderByStripePaymentIntentId` repo lookup + `updateOrder` to `refunded`/`partially_refunded` depending on the
      charge object's own `refunded` boolean; `charge.dispute.created` →
      logs the matched order id (or its absence) — no schema mutation,
      since no `disputed` order status or owner-notification channel exists
      (added to "Blocked — needs human" below rather than guessed at);
      anything else → `console.log` and fall through. Every branch ends by
      calling `markWebhookEventProcessed`.
      `fulfillCheckoutSession` (order-fulfillment.ts) re-derives line items
      from `getCartSummary(session.metadata.cart_id)` — the same source
      `createCheckoutSession` (3.3) built the original Stripe line items
      from, keeping the database the one source of truth for catalog
      identity — but takes money totals (`amount_subtotal`, `amount_total`,
      `shipping_cost.amount_total`, `total_details.amount_tax/discount`)
      directly off the Stripe session, since Stripe is the source of truth
      for payment amounts (AGENT.md), including tax/shipping Stripe itself
      computed. Creates the order via the existing `orders.createOrder`
      (already one transaction for order+items), then decrements inventory
      per line (`recordMovement`, reason `sale`) and empties the cart via a
      new `deleteCartItemsByCartId` repo function (deletes `cart_items`
      rows, leaves the `carts` row itself — the `cart_id` cookie keeps
      pointing at it).
      **Deliberate scope boundary, not an oversight:** order-fulfillment's
      three writes (order+items, inventory movements, cart-clear) are NOT
      yet one atomic database transaction — this task's AC ("replaying the
      same event twice creates exactly one order and decrements inventory
      once") is satisfied by the webhook_events idempotency guard
      (`fulfillCheckoutSession` runs at most once per Stripe event id), not
      by transactional atomicity across all four writes. Wrapping them into
      one `db.transaction` with an explicit partial-failure rollback test is
      fix_plan's own next task, 3.5, by design (same "pure decision /
      apply+harden" split as 1.4a/b, 3.2a/b).
      Tests: `webhook-events.test.ts` (3), `cart.test.ts`
      (+2 for `deleteCartItemsByCartId`), `orders.test.ts` (+2 for
      `getOrderByStripePaymentIntentId`), `order-fulfillment.test.ts` (3 —
      happy path incl. stock decrement + cart-empty assertions, no
      cart_id metadata, empty cart), `stripe/webhook.test.ts` (12 — valid
      signature parses, invalid signature throws, replay is a true no-op
      (one order, one `sale` movement, `webhook_events.processed_at` set),
      unhandled event type logs + still marks processed,
      `payment_intent.payment_failed` logs only, `charge.refunded` full and
      partial refund branches, refund with no matching order, dispute with
      a matching order, dispute/refund with a null `payment_intent` —
      the last two added specifically to clear `src/lib/stripe/**`'s 90%
      branch floor, not padding), `route.test.ts` (4 — valid signature end
      to end via the exported `POST`, invalid signature returns 400 and
      writes no `webhook_events` row, missing signature header returns 400,
      unhandled type returns 200). All confirmed red first (missing
      exports/import-resolution errors) before implementing.
      AC met, verified two ways: `npm run verify` green (49 files, 405
      tests, 98.42/93.88/100/98.36% global coverage — `src/lib/stripe/**`'s
      90% floor and `src/lib/services/**`'s 90% floor both clear in
      aggregate; build's route table shows `ƒ /api/webhooks/stripe`), and a
      real `next dev` server hit with `curl` using a genuinely
      `stripe.webhooks.generateTestHeaderString`-signed payload against the
      real `.env.local` `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: an unhandled-type event
      (`customer.created`) returned `200 {"received":true}` and left a
      `webhook_events` row with `processed_at` set (confirmed via `psql`,
      then deleted — a real, not mocked, live-server round trip, not just
      direct-function-call tests); the same payload replayed with a
      deliberately wrong signature returned
      `400 {"error":"invalid signature"}`.
      NOTE for 3.5: harden `fulfillCheckoutSession`'s three writes into one
      `withTransaction` call (repos/transaction.ts already exists, built for
      exactly this in 1.4b) and add the explicit partial-failure rollback
      test 3.5's own AC requires.
      NOTE for 3.6 (oversell guard): `fulfillCheckoutSession` does not
      compute `order_items.oversold_quantity` yet (stays at the schema's
      default 0) — 1.7's NOTE already flagged this as checkout's job; 3.6 is
      where "re-check stock ... at webhook time" and the oversold math both
      belong together, not this task.
      NOTE for 4.8 (Refunds): `charge.refunded`'s "optionally restock" half
      of the spec's Action column is intentionally not implemented — only
      the order status transition is. Restocking on refund is a business
      decision (a hand-damaged returned candle may not be resellable) better
      made in the admin refunds flow, not assumed here.

- [x] **3.5 Order creation + inventory decrement**
      Deps: 3.4. Single database transaction: create order, create order items,
      write inventory movements, empty the cart.
      AC: a failure partway through rolls back entirely — no orphaned order rows,
      no phantom inventory movements. Test the failure path explicitly.
      `src/lib/services/order-fulfillment.ts`'s `fulfillCheckoutSession` now
      wraps the order+items insert, every line's `recordMovement` call, and
      `deleteCartItemsByCartId` in one `withTransaction` (`src/lib/repos/
transaction.ts`, from 1.4b) — 3.4 had these as four independent writes;
      this task made them atomic.
      `src/lib/repos/orders.ts`'s `createOrder` gained a third, optional
      `executor: DbExecutor = db` param: with no executor it still opens its
      own `db.transaction` (unchanged, so 1.3d's standalone atomicity test
      needed no changes), but given a `tx` it runs both inserts against that
      `tx` directly instead of nesting a second transaction — that's what
      lets it participate in `fulfillCheckoutSession`'s outer transaction.
      `recordMovement`/`deleteCartItemsByCartId` already took an optional
      executor from earlier tasks; no changes needed there.
      Test: new case in `order-fulfillment.test.ts` — spies `recordMovement`
      to reject once (a real FK-violation-style forced failure, like 1.3d's
      atomicity test uses, wasn't constructible here: `getCartSummary`
      already re-verifies every line's variant is real/active before
      `fulfillCheckoutSession` ever runs, so there's no naturally-bad value
      left over to violate a constraint with at the inventory-movement step
      — a spy-based fault injection was the only way to force a failure at
      that specific point), then asserts via direct DB queries that no order
      was created, stock is unaffected, and the cart item survives.
      Confirmed red first: ran this test against the pre-3.5 code and
      observed the order persisting (found by session id) despite the
      injected inventory-write rejection, since the four writes ran outside
      any shared transaction — exactly the bug this task fixes.
      AC met: `npm run verify` green — 49 files, 406 tests, 98.42/93.92/100/
      98.36% global coverage (`src/lib/services/**` aggregate 97.65/90.55/
      100/97.58 clears its 90% floor), build passes.
      See `specs/05-payments.md`'s updated "Implementation notes (3.4)"
      section for the full detail.

- [x] **3.6 Oversell guard**
      Deps: 3.5. Re-check stock at session creation and again at webhook time.
      AC: two concurrent checkouts for the last unit result in one fulfilled order
      and one that is caught and refunded/flagged. Concurrency test required.
      Session-creation recheck already existed (2.7b's `getCartSummary`
      re-clamps every read against live stock) — this task is the webhook-time
      half. `orderStatus` gained `needs_attention` (migration
      `0003_mighty_killraven.sql`, additive `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`), per
      the spec's own wording — not "refunded," which the spec explicitly
      rules out ("we do not silently refund, because a hand-made business
      often can make one more"). Followed the spec over this bullet's own
      looser "refunded/flagged" phrasing.
      New `src/lib/repos/inventory.ts` function `lockVariantStock(variantId,
    executor)` — a `pg_advisory_xact_lock` keyed on the variant id,
      transaction-scoped (auto-released at commit/rollback, no unlock call).
      `variant_stock` is an aggregate view, so `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` isn't
      available; the advisory lock is the substitute. `order-fulfillment.ts`'s
      `fulfillCheckoutSession` now locks every distinct variant in the cart,
      in ascending sorted order (deadlock-free ordering across concurrent
      transactions sharing variants), re-reads stock per line, and computes
      `oversoldQuantity = max(0, quantity - stock)` — written to
      `order_items.oversoldQuantity` (schema column existed since 1.7, never
      actually computed until now). A backorder-allowed (`allowBackorder:
    true`) variant being oversold is expected/legal (1.7) and does not flag
      the order; only an oversold **non**-backorder variant sets the whole
      order's status to `needs_attention`. Inventory is still decremented by
      the full requested quantity either way — the guard changes the order's
      label, not what was charged.
      Owner notification is `console.error` only — same gap as 3.4's dispute
      handler (no real channel exists yet); see "Blocked — needs human"
      below, extended rather than duplicated.
      Tests (`order-fulfillment.test.ts`, 2 new): a backorder variant oversold
      by a single call stays `"paid"` with `oversoldQuantity` recorded (proves
      "expected oversell" doesn't false-positive); two carts racing for the
      last unit of a non-backorder variant, fulfilled via a real `Promise.all`
      against the dev database (not a mocked race), end with exactly one order
      `"needs_attention"` and one `"paid"`, `oversoldQuantity` summing to 1
      across both, final stock -1. Both confirmed red first (both orders
      `"paid"`, `oversoldQuantity` always 0) against the pre-3.6 code, and
      re-ran 4x to check for flakiness before trusting the concurrency test.
      AC met: `npm run verify` green — 49 files, 408 tests, 98.45/93.85/100/
      98.39% global coverage (`src/lib/services/**` aggregate clears its 90%
      floor; `order-fulfillment.ts` alone sits at 67.74% branches, but every
      uncovered branch there — `session.customer_email`/`shipping_cost`/
      `total_details`/`payment_intent`-shape fallbacks — predates this task,
      confirmed via `git stash` + an isolated coverage run against the
      pre-3.6 file, not a gap this task introduced), build passes.
      See `specs/05-payments.md`'s new "Implementation notes (3.6)" for the
      full trace, including why the lock has to be acquired via the
      transaction's own executor, not the module-level `db`.
      NOTE for 3.7 (confirmation email): a `needs_attention` order still
      needs _some_ customer-facing signal eventually (the spec doesn't say
      the customer is told, only the owner) — decide with the owner whether
      the receipt email's copy should differ for this status, or whether
      that's purely an owner-side concern for now.
      NOTE for 4.6/4.9 (orders dashboard / audit log): `needs_attention`
      orders have no dashboard surface yet — today the only way to find one
      is a direct query (`listOrdersByStatus("needs_attention")` already
      works, added no new repo function since 1.3d's existing one is generic
      over status).

- [ ] **3.7 Confirmation page + transactional email**
      Deps: 3.5. Success page keyed by session id (not order id — don't leak an
      enumerable identifier). Receipt email via Resend.
      AC: refreshing the success page does not duplicate anything; email renders in
      plain text as well as HTML; email sending failure does not fail the order.

- [ ] **3.8 Discount codes**
      Deps: 3.3. Percentage and fixed-amount, expiry, usage cap, min-spend.
      AC: expired/exhausted codes are rejected server-side with a clear message;
      a code cannot be applied twice; validation is server-side only.

---

## Phase 3b — Subscription boxes and bookings

See `specs/05b-billing-and-bookings.md` for the full model — amends
`specs/00-overview.md`'s non-goals (subscriptions are now in scope; an
in-house booking calendar is not). Sequenced after one-time Checkout
(3.1–3.8) since both new offering types share its Stripe client, webhook
endpoint, and order/inventory infrastructure, but deliberately **not**
gated on Phase 4 (Admin portal) — see the spec's "Sequencing decision"
section for why neither bookings nor fixed-content box plans need admin
CRUD to exist first.

- [ ] **3b.1 Service types + booking Checkout session**
      Deps: 3.1. `service_types` table + repo. Checkout session in `payment`
      mode, price server-derived from `service_types`, `metadata: {
service_type_id }`.
      AC: a tampered client price/service id produces a session with the
      correct server-derived amount (same mandatory test shape as 3.3).

- [ ] **3b.2 Booking webhook + confirmation**
      Deps: 3b.1, 3.4. Webhook branches on `metadata.service_type_id` within
      `checkout.session.completed` (payment mode) to create a `bookings` row
      (`pending_schedule`), distinct from a cart-metadata physical order.
      Confirmation email via Resend: "we'll follow up by email to schedule."
      AC: replaying the event creates exactly one booking; a cart-metadata
      session and a booking-metadata session are never confused.

- [ ] **3b.3 Box plans schema + CLI seed script**
      Deps: 1.3. `box_plans` + `box_plan_items` tables/repos. CLI script
      (mirrors `scripts/import-catalog.mts`'s pattern) for the owner to
      define/edit a plan's fixed contents — no admin UI.
      AC: script run twice with the same input is idempotent (no duplicate
      `box_plan_items` rows); a plan referencing a nonexistent variant SKU is
      rejected with a clear error, not silently skipped.

- [ ] **3b.4 Box plan → Stripe sync**
      Deps: 3b.3, 3.2. Extends 3.2's variant→Price sync mechanism to
      `box_plans` (recurring Price, not one-time). Same idempotency and
      immutable-Price-archival rules — do not fork a second sync
      implementation.
      AC: running sync twice creates no duplicate Prices/Products; a price
      change on an active plan archives the old Price and creates a new one.

- [ ] **3b.5 Subscription Checkout session**
      Deps: 3b.4. `mode: "subscription"`, `metadata: { box_plan_id }`, price
      server-derived from `box_plans`.
      AC: a tampered client plan id/price produces a session with the
      correct server-derived amount.

- [ ] **3b.6 Subscription + recurring-order webhook handling**
      Deps: 3b.5, 3.5. `subscriptions` table + repo. Handles
      `checkout.session.completed` (subscription mode, creates `subscriptions`
      row only), `customer.subscription.updated`/`.deleted`, and
      `invoice.paid` (both `billing_reason` values) — the last creates the
      cycle's `orders`/`order_items`/inventory rows from `box_plan_items`,
      reusing 3.5's transactional order-creation path. `orders.subscription_id`
      column added.
      AC: `invoice.paid` replay creates exactly one order; a
      `customer.subscription.deleted` arriving before its
      `checkout.session.completed` does not crash (ordering test, same shape
      as 3.4's). Webhook module stays ≥90% covered per AGENT.md.

- [ ] **3b.7 Recurring oversell guard**
      Deps: 3b.6, 3.6. Applies 1.7/3.6's `stock > 0 OR allow_backorder` rule
      to box fulfillment; a plan item with insufficient stock and no
      backorder flags the generated order `needs_attention` instead of
      silently short-shipping.
      AC: a box plan item that goes out of stock between two billing cycles
      produces a flagged order on the affected cycle, not a crash or a
      silently incomplete shipment.

- [ ] **3b.8 Customer account lookup + Stripe Customer Portal**
      Deps: 3b.6. `/account`-style page: email in, portal-session link out
      (or emailed) if a `stripe_customer_id` is found. No password, no
      session cookie — see spec's "Account lookup" section for the
      enumeration-safe messaging requirement.
      AC: an unknown email and a known-but-canceled-subscription email
      produce the same response (no enumeration signal); a known active
      subscriber reaches a real Stripe Billing Portal session.

---

## Phase 4 — Admin portal

- [ ] **4.1 Admin authentication**
      Deps: 1.1. See `specs/04-admin.md`. Email + argon2id password, httpOnly
      session cookie, `SameSite=Lax`, rotation on login, server-side revocation.
      Rate-limit login (5 attempts / 15 min / IP+email). CSRF tokens on all mutations.
      AC: wrong password, locked-out, expired-session, and CSRF-missing paths are
      each tested. Timing-safe comparison. Passwords never logged. Auth ≥90% covered.

- [ ] **4.2 Route protection**
      Deps: 4.1. Middleware guarding `/admin/**` and admin API routes.
      AC: an unauthenticated request to every admin route redirects/401s — test
      enumerates the routes so a newly added unguarded route fails the suite.

- [ ] **4.3 Product CRUD**
      Deps: 4.2, 1.3. Create, edit, publish/unpublish, soft-delete. Slug generation
      with collision handling. Zod validation shared client and server.
      AC: soft-deleted products vanish from the storefront but remain linked from
      historical orders; validation errors render per-field.

- [ ] **4.4 Variant + inventory management**
      Deps: 4.3. Per-variant SKU, price, stock. Manual stock adjustment writes an
      `inventory_movements` row with a reason.
      AC: stock is never edited directly — it is always derived from movements, so
      the ledger and the displayed count cannot diverge.

- [ ] **4.5 Image upload**
      Deps: 4.3. Cloudflare R2 via presigned URLs. Validate MIME by magic bytes not
      extension, cap size, strip EXIF, generate responsive sizes, set alt text.
      AC: a `.png`-named file that is actually a script is rejected; alt text is
      required before publish.

- [ ] **4.6 Orders dashboard**
      Deps: 3.5, 4.2. List with status filter and search; detail view with items,
      totals, addresses, Stripe payment link.
      AC: totals shown always equal the sum of stored line items — assert this
      rather than recomputing in the view.

- [ ] **4.7 Fulfillment** (revised 2026-07-23 — see `specs/09-shipping.md`)
      Deps: 4.6. Real USPS label purchase via Shippo, not a typed-in
      carrier/tracking pair. Split into sub-tasks below (new external
      provider + live-mode interlock is a full task on its own, mirroring
      3.1/3.2's split for the Stripe client + sync service). This umbrella
      item is ticked `[x]` only once both below are `[x]`.

  - [ ] **4.7a Shippo client + rate/label service**
        Deps: 3.1 (mirrors its pattern, no code dependency). `src/lib/shipping/client.ts`
        — pinned client, fetch-based HTTP, `ALLOW_LIVE` interlock reusing
        the exact `assertNotLiveModeUnlessAllowed` logic from
        `src/lib/stripe/client.ts` (shared helper or copy verbatim with the
        token param renamed — same rule, don't reinvent it).
        `src/lib/shipping/config.ts` — `SHIP_FROM_ADDRESS`/`DEFAULT_PARCEL`
        constants (owner-supplied real values; see fix_plan's "Blocked —
        needs human" entry added alongside this task).
        `src/lib/services/shipping.ts` — `getRatesForOrder(orderId)` (calls
        Shippo rates using the order's real address + computed parcel
        weight) and `purchaseLabel(orderId, rateId)` (buys the label,
        writes a `shipments` row, sets `orders.fulfilled_at`/`status`).
        AC: `getRatesForOrder` returns real Shippo rate options against a
        mocked response (MSW, `tests/msw/shippo-server.ts` — same pattern as
        `tests/msw/stripe-server.ts`); `purchaseLabel` writes exactly one
        `shipments` row and flips order status; a repeat/duplicate purchase
        attempt on an already-fulfilled order is rejected, not double-billed.
        `src/lib/shipping/**` and the new service function held to the 90%
        floor (`vitest.config.mts` thresholds gain a `src/lib/shipping/**`
        entry alongside `services`/`stripe`/`auth`).

  - [ ] **4.7b Fulfillment UI**
        Deps: 4.7a, 4.6. Order detail: "Get shipping rates" → list of
        carrier/service/price options → "Buy label" → tracking number/label
        link shown, shipping-notice email sent (reuses 3.7's Resend
        infrastructure). "Void label" action for a mis-purchased label
        (writes a new `voided` `shipments` row, doesn't mutate/delete the
        original — ledger-style, matching `inventory_movements`).
        AC: status transitions are validated (cannot fetch rates/buy a label
        for a refunded/cancelled order); each action (rate fetch excluded —
        it's read-only) writes to `audit_log`.

- [ ] **4.8 Refunds**
      Deps: 4.6, 3.4. Full and partial refunds through Stripe; restock optional.
      AC: refund is initiated via Stripe and the local order status is updated by
      the resulting webhook, not optimistically in the request handler.

- [ ] **4.9 Audit log view**
      Deps: 4.7. Who did what, when, to which record.
      AC: every admin mutation appears; the log is append-only with no UI to edit it.

---

## Phase 5 — Hardening

- [ ] **5.1 Security headers + rate limiting**
      Deps: 4.2. CSP (nonce-based, Stripe domains allowlisted), HSTS,
      `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`.
      Rate-limit cart, checkout, login, and contact endpoints.
      AC: CSP has no `unsafe-inline` for scripts; Stripe Checkout redirect still works.

- [ ] **5.2 Accessibility pass**
      Deps: 2.5, 2.7. axe assertions on every page-level test. Keyboard-only path
      from listing → product → cart → checkout. Focus management on modals.
      AC: zero serious/critical axe violations; the keyboard path is an E2E test.

- [ ] **5.3 Error handling + monitoring**
      Deps: 0.5. Error boundaries, `not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`, Sentry with PII
      scrubbing.
      AC: a thrown server error shows a friendly page and reports once; no card
      data, email, or address reaches Sentry — test the scrubber.

- [ ] **5.4 Performance budget**
      Deps: 2.5. Lighthouse CI in the pipeline. Images via `next/image`, correct
      `sizes`, LCP image preloaded.
      AC: mobile Lighthouse ≥90 performance / 100 accessibility on the listing and
      product pages; CI fails if it regresses.

- [ ] **5.5 E2E suite**
      Deps: 3.7, 4.3. Playwright: browse → filter → product → cart → checkout with
      Stripe test card `4242…` → webhook → order visible in admin. Plus a declined
      card (`4000000000000002`) and a 3DS card (`4000002500003155`).
      AC: the suite runs green in CI against test-mode Stripe with the CLI forwarding
      webhooks.

- [ ] **5.6 Backups + restore drill**
      Deps: 1.1. Automated daily Postgres backup; documented restore.
      AC: a restore into a scratch database is actually performed and the steps that
      worked are written into `specs/08-deploy-ops.md`.

---

## Phase 6 — Launch

- [x] **6.0 Cloudflare Workers adapter wiring** (pulled ahead 2026-07-22 —
      owner connected the git repo to a Cloudflare account and started the
      Workers Builds setup, so the repo needed to be deployable now; the
      full staging AC still belongs to 6.1)
      `@opennextjs/cloudflare@1.20.2` (dependency; peer-supports Next
      16.2.11 exactly) + `wrangler@4.113.0` (dev) + `@neondatabase/serverless`.
      New `wrangler.jsonc` (worker name `fhcwebsite`, `nodejs_compat`,
      assets binding, WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE, observability),
      `open-next.config.ts` (defaults — no ISR cache, catalog routes are
      force-dynamic), `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev()` in `next.config.ts`,
      `preview`/`deploy` npm scripts, `.dev.vars*` gitignored.
      `src/lib/db/client.ts` now picks its driver at module load: on workerd
      (`navigator.userAgent === "Cloudflare-Workers"`) it uses Neon's
      serverless **HTTP** driver (stateless fetch per query — Workers can't
      hold TCP/pg sockets across requests); everywhere else (dev, tests,
      CLI scripts, CI) the existing `pg` Pool. CAVEAT recorded in the file:
      neon-http has no interactive `db.transaction` — fine while all
      Workers-side DB paths are reads; 3.5's order-creation transaction must
      use a per-request WebSocket Pool from `@neondatabase/serverless`.
      GOTCHA (cost an hour): `opennextjs-cloudflare build` failed on
      `Could not resolve "pg-cloudflare"` — Next's output tracing resolves
      pg's optional shim through the exports `default` condition (an empty
      stub) so `dist/index.js` never lands in the traced node_modules, but
      OpenNext's esbuild resolves under the `workerd` condition and wants
      the real file. Fixed with `outputFileTracingIncludes` pinning
      `node_modules/pg-cloudflare/{dist,esm}/**` into every route's trace.
      Verified: `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` produces
      `.open-next/worker.js` cleanly; full `npm run verify` green.
      NOT verified here: `wrangler dev`/`deploy` from this sandbox —
      wrangler 4 requires Node ≥22, sandbox has 20.15. Cloudflare's build
      image runs Node 22+, so dashboard-driven builds are unaffected.
      Dashboard config (owner performed): build command
      `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`, deploy command
      `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy`, env vars per `.env.example`
      (DATABASE_URL → Neon pooled URL, Stripe TEST keys, NEXT_PUBLIC_* at
      build time, ALLOW_LIVE=false). Migrations against Neon run manually
      (`DATABASE_URL=<neon> npm run db:migrate`) until a deploy-step
      migration job exists (08-deploy-ops pipeline).

- [ ] **6.1 Staging deploy**
      Deps: 5.5. Cloudflare Workers + Neon, still Stripe test mode.
      AC: full E2E passes against the deployed staging URL.

- [ ] **6.2 Domain, DNS, TLS**
      Deps: 6.1. 🚦 HUMAN GATE — owner controls the registrar.
      AC: apex and `www` resolve, TLS valid, one canonical redirect direction.

- [ ] **6.3 Production environment**
      Deps: 6.2. Secrets in the platform store; production database separate from
      staging with its own credentials.
      AC: no secret appears in the repo or in build logs.

- [ ] **6.4 Stripe live mode**
      Deps: 6.3. 🚦 HUMAN GATE — the owner performs this step.
      Live keys, live webhook endpoint + signing secret, business details, payout
      account, tax registrations.
      AC: one real low-value order is placed, fulfilled, and refunded end to end.

- [ ] **6.5 Analytics**
      Deps: 6.3. Plausible or Umami — cookieless, no consent banner needed.
      AC: pageviews and checkout completions recorded; no third-party ad trackers.

- [ ] **6.6 Shopify migration**

## Blocked — needs human

_(agent appends here; do not guess around a blocker)_

- Brand assets: logo, real color palette, product photography. 2.1 shipped
  with a placeholder warm-neutral/terracotta palette (`src/app/globals.css`)
  so the layout shell could be built and tested now — swapping in the owner's
  actual palette/logo later is a one-file edit. Still needed before launch,
  and definitely before 2.6 (OG images) and 5.4 (Lighthouse/LCP image) make
  photography decisions load-bearing.
- Policy copy: shipping, returns, privacy, terms — needed for 2.8.
- Brand-story narrative copy ("About the maker" paragraph) for the home
  page — `specs/03-storefront.md`'s route table calls for it alongside
  featured products, but 2.9's own AC never required it and was closed
  without it (2026-07-23). The hero section it belongs in already exists
  in `src/app/page.tsx`, ready to extend once the owner supplies text.
- Confirmation on cosmetics labeling: MoCRA requires an ingredient list and a
  responsible-person contact for body butter; candles need ASTM F2417 fire-safety
  warnings. Product data model assumes these fields exist. Needed for 1.1.
- ~~Real Shopify product CSV export: needed to actually run
  `npm run import-catalog -- <file> --apply` for the first time (1.4b).~~
  RESOLVED 2026-07-22: owner confirmed `tests/fixtures/catalog.csv` as the
  starting catalog and authorized the first `--apply`. Imported clean
  (5 products / 45 variants, zero row errors) after a `db:reset` cleared
  stale rows from an older fixture. See 1.4b's closed gate note and new
  task 1.5.
- ~~**51 stray real Stripe test-mode Products/Prices from a 3.2b debugging
  incident (2026-07-23), owner decision needed.**~~ RESOLVED 2026-07-23:
  owner authorized option (c) — Stripe API cleanup, archived via
  `active: false`.
  Before archiving anything, re-verified which objects were actually stray:
  the original 51-count assumed the 45 real-catalog-named Products/Prices
  from the incident were duplicates of a separate, later "real" sync. They
  weren't. `runStripeSync`'s idempotency keys are derived from
  `variant.id` (`specs/05-payments.md`'s "Implementation notes (3.2b)",
  Idempotency design section), so when the owner's 2026-07-23 `npm run
sync-stripe -- --apply` ran the create step for those same 45 variants, Stripe
  replayed the exact same idempotency-keyed objects from the incident rather
  than creating new ones — the incident's 45 catalog-named objects and the
  "real" sync's output are the same 45 objects. Confirmed by cross-checking
  every `product_variants.stripe_price_id` in the local dev DB (45 rows)
  against a live `GetPrices` list: all 45 matched exactly, none missing,
  none extra. The genuinely orphaned set was 7 objects, not 51 — six of the
  originally-named "Test {create,rerun,archived,replace,noop,missing} — Test
  Variant" fixtures plus a second, previously-uncounted "Test create — Test
  Variant" (`prod_UwIT8Gt9BmIIEB`) from a later test run. All 7 Prices
  (`price_1TwPtP…`, `…se…`, `…sZ…`, `…sY…`, `…sW…`, `…sU…`, `…sT…`) and their
  7 parent Products (`prod_UwIUtmR5OmXNlq`, `prod_UwITsKT9casIpc`,
  `prod_UwITZSjPsPeOcv`, `prod_UwITVoATeWsthX`, `prod_UwITCbBQ0eAwoq`,
  `prod_UwIT1OFsN107pj`, `prod_UwIT8Gt9BmIIEB`) were set to `active: false`
  via `PostPricesPrice`/`PostProductsId`. The 45 real-catalog objects were
  left untouched and re-verified still `active: true` with matching price
  IDs after the cleanup. No live-mode objects were touched at any point.
  NOTE for anyone re-deriving this in the future: don't trust a stray-object
  count written before a later `--apply` run without re-checking against the
  DB's current `stripe_price_id` values first — idempotency-key replay can
  silently fold an "incident" object into the "real" one.
- **Flat shipping rate is a placeholder (3.3).** `checkout.ts`'s
  `FLAT_RATE_SHIPPING_CENTS = 600` ($6.00 US-only) is a made-up number so
  checkout could ship without inventing the shipping-rate admin surface
  early (that's 4.x's Settings page, specs/04-admin.md). Owner should
  confirm/replace with real carrier rates before launch.
- **Stripe Tax needs a Dashboard origin address (3.3).** `checkout.ts` sends
  `automatic_tax: {enabled: true}` unconditionally, but a real (non-mocked)
  Checkout Session creation call will fail until the connected Stripe
  account has an origin address configured under Tax settings — that's a
  Dashboard step, not something code can do. Untested against live Stripe
  in 3.3 for the same reason 3.2b's `--apply` wasn't (see the stray-objects
  entry above) — verify this once the owner is ready to run a real session.
- ~~**Checkout requires 3.2's `--apply` to have actually been run (3.3).** A
  cart line whose variant has no `stripePriceId` yet makes
  `createCheckoutSession` return `unavailable` for the whole cart — by
  design (specs/05-payments.md's "Implementation notes (3.3)": line items
  reference the synced Stripe Price, never an ad-hoc `price_data` block).
  The real dev DB's catalog is still unsynced (same blocker as the 51
  stray-objects entry above), so checkout is not yet usable end-to-end
  against the real catalog — confirmed live via `next dev` + curl, which
  correctly hit the `unavailable` guard rather than crashing or mischarging.
  Resolving the stray-objects decision above and running `--apply` for real
  unblocks this too.~~ RESOLVED 2026-07-23: owner ran `npm run sync-stripe --
--apply` for real against the dev DB. Verified — all 45 `FC_%` variants now
  have a non-null `stripe_price_id`. Checkout is unblocked end-to-end against
  the real catalog. (The 51 stray-objects cleanup decision above is separate
  and still open — it's about tidying up leftover test-mode clutter, not
  about the catalog sync itself.)

- **Weight-tiered shipping prices are guesses, not real rates (3.3b).**
  `checkout.ts`'s `SHIPPING_BANDS` charges $5.00 (under 1 lb), $8.00 (1-3
  lb), $12.00 (3+ lb) — made-up numbers picked to be "strictly better than
  one flat rate," not numbers read off a real Shippo/USPS rate card (Shippo
  isn't integrated until 4.7a, so there's no rate card to read yet). Owner
  should confirm/replace before launch, same category as the flat rate it
  replaced.
- ~~**Ship-from address and default parcel size, needed for 4.7a**~~
  RESOLVED 2026-07-23 (address 2026-07-23, name + parcel 2026-07-23):
  - **Address**: PO Box, "57280 Yucca Trl, Yucca Valley, CA 92284-7915"
    (country assumed `US`, not stated). **Name/company: "FHC"** (owner-
    supplied, use for Shippo's address object `name` or `company` field —
    no separate person name given, "FHC" covers both).
  - `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` already live in `.env.local` (`shippo_test_…`,
    confirmed test-mode).
  - **`DEFAULT_PARCEL`** — corrected 2026-07-23 (owner's first answer named
    the Small Flat Rate Box; that was wrong, replaced same day — see
    `specs/09-shipping.md`'s "Config: parcel defaults" section for the
    canonical version, this entry is history/trace only). It's two parcels:
    (a) **ceiling parcel** = USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate® **Envelope**,
    Shippo predefined template `USPS_FlatRateEnvelope` (12.50" × 9.50" ×
    0.75", docs.goshippo.com, confirmed 2026-07-23) — use the template
    name, not hand-typed dimensions; (b) **fine-grained parcel** = a plain
    owner-supplied **6" × 4" × 3" box**, no USPS template, real
    weight/zone-priced rates. Tare weight for either wasn't looked
    up/confirmed — treat as a few ounces, not blocking.
  - **Rate-selection policy for `getRatesForOrder`/`purchaseLabel` (4.7a)**:
    request Shippo rates for **both** parcels using the order's real
    computed weight, then **pick the cheapest rate across both
    responses**, not always the Flat Rate service specifically. Owner's
    framing: "use pricing that maxes out ... as the cost for [the flat
    rate parcel] ... and if by that size/weight it's cheaper to send to
    address use that price instead" — since USPS Flat Rate pricing is
    fixed regardless of weight/zone (up to 70 lb) by design, it acts as a
    natural price _ceiling_ for anything that fits the envelope; the 6×4×3
    box's real rates can be cheaper for a light package or a short zone,
    and should win when they are. This is a real behavioral requirement
    for 4.7a's rate-selection logic, not just a config value — recorded in
    `specs/09-shipping.md` alongside `DEFAULT_PARCEL`, don't let it get
    lost as a comment.
    4.7a is now fully unblocked on config; nothing left in this entry.
- **No `disputed` order status or owner-notification channel (3.4).**
  `specs/05-payments.md`'s webhook table says `charge.dispute.created`
  should "flag order, notify owner" — `orders.status`'s enum has no
  `disputed` value (`pending|paid|fulfilled|cancelled|refunded|
partially_refunded`) and no notification channel exists yet (3.7 wires
  up Resend for receipt emails only, to the customer, not the owner).
  `src/lib/stripe/webhook.ts`'s dispute handler currently only
  `console.error`s the matched order id — a real fix needs either a schema
  decision (new `disputed_at` column? repurpose a status value?) or an
  owner-notification decision (email? SMS? dashboard badge, deferred to
  4.9's audit log view?), not a guess made mid-webhook-task.
  NOTE (3.6): the oversell guard hit the exact same "no owner-notification
  channel" gap and also only `console.error`s (see `order-fulfillment.ts`) —
  unlike disputes, that task's status value (`needs_attention`) _did_ get
  added to the schema, since specs/05-payments.md named it explicitly. The
  missing piece for both is only the notification channel itself.
- **USPS Hazmat/carrier-restriction confirmation for candles, needed before
  4.7's first real label purchase and definitely before any international
  shipping** (`specs/07-security-legal.md`'s existing flammable-goods flag,
  `specs/09-shipping.md`'s "Legal / carrier restrictions" section). Finished
  candles generally ship fine domestically via USPS ground/Priority, but the
  owner (or Shippo support) should confirm the specific product line's
  classification before this goes live — not a code decision.
